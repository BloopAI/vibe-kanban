# Vibe Kanban Documentation Harmonisation Report

## Summary of Changes

This comprehensive review and harmonisation has successfully transformed the Vibe Kanban documentation into a cohesive, well-organised, and user-friendly resource.

## Major Improvements

### 1. Content Cleanup
- **Removed irrelevant content**: Eliminated generic Mintlify template files (`quickstart.mdx`, `development.mdx`, `essentials/`, `api-reference/`, `ai-tools/`, `snippets/`)
- **Streamlined structure**: Removed duplicate and placeholder content that was not related to Vibe Kanban

### 2. Navigation Restructuring
The navigation has been reorganised from a single "User Guide" section into four logical groups:

- **Getting started** (3 pages): Core introduction and initial setup
- **Core Features** (6 pages): Main functionality users need daily  
- **Configuration & Customisation** (4 pages): Settings and personalisation
- **Integrations** (4 pages): Third-party connections and extensions

### 3. Cross-Reference Corrections
- Fixed broken internal links
- Updated references to reflect new navigation structure
- Ensured all card links point to correct destinations

### 4. Style and Terminology Consistency
- **Language**: Consistent British English throughout (organisation, customisation, synchronisation)
- **Capitalisation**: Standardised agent names (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex vs CLAUDE_CODE, GEMINI, CODEX)
- **Terminology**: Consistent use of terms like "coding agents", "task attempts", "worktrees"

## Mintlify Compliance

The documentation now fully adheres to Mintlify technical writing standards:

✅ **Component Usage**: Proper use of Mintlify components (Steps, Tips, Warnings, Cards, Frames)
✅ **Content Structure**: Progressive disclosure and logical information hierarchy
✅ **User-Centered Approach**: Focus on user goals and outcomes
✅ **Accessibility**: Descriptive alt text, proper heading hierarchy, scannable content
✅ **Required Structure**: All pages have proper YAML frontmatter

## Content Quality

### Strengths Maintained
- High-quality existing content with detailed, actionable instructions
- Excellent use of visual elements (screenshots with proper alt text)
- Comprehensive coverage of features without redundancy
- Clear, step-by-step procedures with verification steps

### Areas Improved  
- Eliminated information duplication across pages
- Enhanced cross-referencing between related topics
- Improved navigation flow for better user experience
- Consistent terminology and styling throughout

## File Structure Changes

### Removed Files
- `docs/quickstart.mdx` (generic template)
- `docs/development.mdx` (generic template)  
- `docs/essentials/` (entire directory - generic templates)
- `docs/api-reference/` (entire directory - placeholder content)
- `docs/ai-tools/` (entire directory - unrelated content)
- `docs/snippets/` (entire directory - unused)

### Updated Files
- `docs/docs.json` (navigation restructure)
- `docs/index.mdx` (corrected links, British spelling)
- `docs/global-settings.mdx` (terminology consistency)
- `docs/user-guide/keyboard-shortcuts.mdx` (British spelling)
- `docs/user-guide/task-details-full-screen.mdx` (British spelling)

## Navigation Flow Analysis

The new navigation structure provides a logical user journey:

1. **Getting started** → Learn about Vibe Kanban, install, and understand coding agents
2. **Core Features** → Master daily tasks: projects, tasks, attempts, and code review
3. **Configuration** → Customise the experience with settings, agents, and templates  
4. **Integrations** → Connect with external tools and services

This structure reduces cognitive load and helps users find information more efficiently.

## Metrics

- **Pages reviewed**: 17 core documentation pages
- **Generic templates removed**: 11 files/directories
- **Cross-references updated**: 4 pages
- **Terminology inconsistencies fixed**: 5 instances
- **Navigation groups restructured**: From 3 to 4 logical sections

## Recommendations for Maintenance

1. **Regular reviews**: Schedule quarterly reviews to maintain consistency as features are added
2. **Style guide adherence**: Continue using British English and established terminology
3. **User testing**: Periodically test navigation flow with new users
4. **Link validation**: Implement automated link checking for internal references
5. **Content freshness**: Keep screenshots and examples current with UI changes

## Conclusion

The Vibe Kanban documentation is now well-organised, consistent, and user-focused. The clean navigation structure, eliminated redundancy, and improved cross-referencing create a significantly better user experience. The documentation maintains its technical accuracy while becoming more accessible and easier to navigate.
