# Allowed legacy frontend files during structure migration
# Any newly added file under these paths should fail CI until moved to the new structure.
# Paths covered:
# - packages/local-web/src/components/ui-new
# - packages/local-web/src/components/dialogs
#
# Intentionally empty: both legacy directories have been removed.
