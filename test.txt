In code we trust, but verify we must,
Through tests that guard against the rust
Of bugs that creep in quiet night,
Our assertions shine their light.

Unit tests so small and clean,
Test the parts we've never seen,
Integration tests that bind
The pieces of our coding mind.

Red, green, refactor's sacred dance,
Gives our software fighting chance,
Each test case a faithful friend,
On whom we can always depend.

Mock the world and stub the call,
Catch the bugs before they fall,
In the realm of ones and zeros,
Tests become our coding heroes.

So write your tests with care and thought,
For quality cannot be bought,
Only through this testing art,
Can we build code close to heart.
