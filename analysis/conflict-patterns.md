## Recurring Conflict Areas

### ðŸ”´ Critical Conflict Hotspots (High Frequency)

#### 1. Database Models & Shared Types
**Files**:
- `crates/db/src/models/task.rs` (appears in 3/3 recent merges)
- `crates/db/src/models/task_attempt.rs` (appears in 3/3 recent merges)
- `shared/types.ts` (appears in 3/3 recent merges)

**Conflict Pattern**: Schema divergence - fork has branch template features
**Resolution Strategy**: Manual merge preserving fork's branch template functionality
**Time Investment**: High (schema conflicts require careful coordination)

#### 2. API Route Endpoints
**Files**:
- `crates/server/src/routes/tasks.rs` (appears in 3/3 recent merges)
- `crates/server/src/routes/task_attempts.rs` (appears in 3/3 recent merges)

**Conflict Pattern**: API endpoint modifications and new route additions
**Resolution Strategy**: Preserve fork's API extensions while adopting upstream improvements
**Time Investment**: Medium-High (API compatibility critical)

#### 3. MCP Server Integration
**Files**:
- `crates/server/src/mcp/task_server.rs` (appears in 2/3 recent merges)

**Conflict Pattern**: Both fork and upstream evolving MCP integration
**Resolution Strategy**: Accept upstream MCP refactoring while preserving fork customizations
**Time Investment**: Medium

### ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Conflict Areas

#### 4. Build & Configuration
**Files**:
- `package.json` (appears in 2/3 recent merges)
- `frontend/package.json` (appears in 3/3 recent merges)
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` (appears in 2/3 recent merges)
- Various `Cargo.toml` files

**Conflict Pattern**: Dependency version conflicts and build script differences
**Resolution Strategy**: Preserve fork's npm publishing setup and automagik-forge branding
**Time Investment**: Medium

#### 5. Executor Systems
**Files**:
- `crates/executors/src/executors/codex.rs` (appears in 2/3 recent merges)
- `crates/local-deployment/src/container.rs` (appears in 2/3 recent merges)

**Conflict Pattern**: Both sides improving executor implementations
**Resolution Strategy**: Merge improvements while preserving fork-specific executor configurations
**Time Investment**: Medium

#### 6. Frontend Components
**Files**:
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreatePRDialog.tsx` (multiple merges)
- `frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskFollowUpSection.tsx` (multiple merges)
- Various dialog components

**Conflict Pattern**: UI improvements conflicting with theme/branding changes
**Resolution Strategy**: Accept upstream UX improvements, reapply fork styling
**Time Investment**: Low-Medium

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Conflict Areas

#### 7. Git & Worktree Management
**Files**:
- `crates/services/src/services/git.rs` (periodic conflicts)
- `crates/services/src/services/worktree_manager.rs` (occasional)

**Conflict Pattern**: Both sides fixing git-related bugs
**Resolution Strategy**: Generally accept upstream fixes
**Time Investment**: Low

## Conflict Resolution Strategies Observed

### 1. **Preservation-First Strategy**
- **Approach**: Always preserve fork-specific features (Omni, Genie, branch templates)
- **Evidence**: Merge commit messages explicitly mention "honoring fork customizations"
- **Success Rate**: High for feature preservation

### 2. **Selective Upstream Adoption**
- **Approach**: Cherry-pick beneficial upstream changes while avoiding disruptive ones
- **Evidence**: "Adopted upstream performance improvements and bug fixes" in merge messages
- **Success Rate**: High for non-conflicting improvements

### 3. **Manual Merge with Documentation**
- **Approach**: Detailed merge commit messages documenting what was preserved vs. adopted
- **Evidence**: Comprehensive merge commit descriptions listing specific changes
- **Success Rate**: High for maintaining merge history clarity

### 4. **Incremental Integration**
- **Approach**: Multiple smaller merges rather than large batch integrations
- **Evidence**: 9 merge attempts in ~2 months
- **Success Rate**: Medium (frequent conflicts but manageable scope)

## Time & Effort Estimates

### Per-Merge Effort (Based on Recent Patterns)

| Conflict Area | Files Affected | Estimated Resolution Time |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Database Models | 2-3 files | 4-6 hours (schema coordination) |
| API Routes | 2-4 files | 3-5 hours (endpoint testing) |
| Build Configuration | 5-8 files | 2-4 hours (dependency management) |
| Frontend Components | 3-6 files | 2-3 hours (styling reapplication) |
| Executor Systems | 1-3 files | 1-3 hours (config merging) |
| Git/Worktree | 1-2 files | 1-2 hours (simple fixes) |

**Total Estimated Merge Time**: 13-23 hours per major upstream integration

### Cumulative Maintenance Overhead

- **Frequency**: ~1 major merge every 2-3 weeks
- **Annual Time Investment**: ~200-400 hours for upstream sync maintenance
- **Risk**: Increasing technical debt as divergence grows

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. **Automated Conflict Detection**
- Pre-merge analysis to identify potential conflicts
- Automated testing of merge scenarios

### 2. **Modular Architecture**
- Isolate fork-specific features to reduce core conflicts
- Use feature flags for optional functionality

### 3. **Upstream Contribution Strategy**
- Contribute generic improvements back to upstream
- Reduce fork-specific modifications where possible

### 4. **Merge Scheduling**
- Coordinate merge timing with upstream release cycles
- Batch related upstream changes together

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas
- Frontend styling and theming
- Documentation and branding
- Fork-specific feature files

### Medium Risk Areas
- Build configuration and dependencies
- Frontend component functionality
- Executor implementations

### High Risk Areas
- Database schema changes
- Core API modifications
- MCP server integration
- Type system modifications

## Recommendations

1. **Establish Merge Windows**: Schedule upstream merges during low-activity periods
2. **Conflict Prevention**: Regular communication with upstream about planned changes
3. **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite to validate post-merge functionality
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of fork-specific modifications
5. **Modularization**: Isolate custom features to minimize core conflicts
