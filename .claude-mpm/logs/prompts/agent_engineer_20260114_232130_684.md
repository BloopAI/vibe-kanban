INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Explore this codebase to understand how the backend is deployed and what deployment options exist. Look for:
1. Deployment-related crates (crates/deployment, crates/local-deployment, crates/remote)
2. Docker/container configurations
3. Any existing deployment scripts or documentation
4. Backend configuration options (environment variables, config files)
5. Database requirements (SQLx, migrations)
6. How the server binary is built and what it needs to run

Focus on understanding what's needed to deploy the backend to a remote server.
