# Vibe Kanban

> A visual project management tool for developers that integrates with git repositories and coding agents like Claude Code and Amp.

## Quick Start

Run vibe kanban instantly without installation:

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

This will launch the application locally and open it in your browser automatically.

## What is Vibe Kanban?

Vibe Kanban is a modern project management tool designed specifically for developers. It helps you organize your coding projects with kanban-style task management while providing powerful integrations with git repositories and AI coding agents.

### ‚ú® Key Features

**üóÇÔ∏è Project Management**
- Add git repositories as projects (existing or create new ones)
- Automatic git integration and repository validation
- Project search functionality across all files
- Custom setup and development scripts per project

**üìã Task Management**
- Create and manage tasks with kanban-style boards
- Task status tracking (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- Rich task descriptions and notes
- Task execution with multiple AI agents

**ü§ñ AI Agent Integration**
- **Claude**: Advanced AI coding assistant
- **Amp**: Powerful development agent
- **Echo**: Simple testing/debugging agent
- Create tasks and immediately start agent execution
- Follow-up task execution for iterative development

**‚ö° Development Workflow**
- Create isolated git worktrees for each task attempt
- View diffs of changes made by agents
- Merge successful changes back to main branch
- Rebase task branches to stay up-to-date
- Manual file editing and deletion
- Integrated development server support

**üéõÔ∏è Developer Tools**
- Browse and validate git repositories from filesystem
- Open task worktrees in your preferred editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, IntelliJ, Zed)
- Real-time execution monitoring and process control
- Stop running processes individually or all at once
- Sound notifications for task completion

## How It Works

1. **Add Projects**: Import existing git repositories or create new ones
2. **Create Tasks**: Define what needs to be built or fixed
3. **Execute with AI**: Let coding agents work on your tasks in isolated environments
4. **Review Changes**: See exactly what was modified using git diffs
5. **Merge Results**: Incorporate successful changes into your main codebase
