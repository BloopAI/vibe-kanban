We are going through the process of building keyboard shortcut functionality for this app based on a new approach. You can find the general approach in @ and the specific implementation plan we are following in @

Current we have just implemented phase _ and are now moving on to phase _.

Review whta was done so far and then plan out how you will go about implementating the next phase. 

Be sure to ask me any unresolved questions you have or questions when you need help deciding something.

Make sure the plan includes a step at the end to update the keyboard-shortcut-implementation.md with the current progress and useful notes from this phase for future ones.
