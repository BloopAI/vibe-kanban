- Read `packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md` and assessed the next low-risk Track 1 component migration.
- Selected `LoginRequiredPrompt` as the next reusable dialog-surface component to move into canonical shared UI placement.
- Performed full refactor with move-first workflow:
  - Used `git mv` to move
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/LoginRequiredPrompt.tsx`
    -> `src/shared/ui/dialogs/LoginRequiredPrompt.tsx`.
  - Added compatibility shim at legacy path:
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/LoginRequiredPrompt.tsx`.
  - Updated callsite to canonical path:
    `src/features/kanban/ui/ProjectKanban.tsx` now imports
    `@/shared/ui/dialogs/LoginRequiredPrompt`.
- Updated Track 1 plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for this migration.
  - Added new-information note documenting the single cross-scope callsite in
    `features/kanban` and why it was updated.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Continue `T1.4/T1.6/T1.7` with another reusable dialog migration in Track 1,
  preferably `ConfirmDialog` into `src/shared/ui/dialogs/*` with a legacy shim
  and canonical import updates.

## 2026-02-22 11:09:52 UTC

- Read `packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md` and `progress.txt`, then assessed the next reusable dialog migration in Track 1.
- Selected `FolderPickerDialog` as the next low-risk component to move into canonical shared UI placement.
- Performed full refactor with move-first workflow:
  - Used `git mv` to move
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/FolderPickerDialog.tsx`
    -> `src/shared/ui/dialogs/FolderPickerDialog.tsx`.
  - Added compatibility shim at legacy path:
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/FolderPickerDialog.tsx`.
  - Updated all direct callsites to canonical import path:
    - `src/components/ui-new/containers/CreateModeRepoPickerBar.tsx`
    - `src/components/ui-new/dialogs/settings/GeneralSettingsSection.tsx`
- New information discovered and handled:
  - After move, ESLint rejected NiceModal default import in `shared/ui/dialogs`.
  - Fixed by switching `FolderPickerDialog` to named imports from
    `@ebay/nice-modal-react` (`create`, `useModal`) rather than default import.
  - Documented this constraint in the Track 1 plan for subsequent shared dialog moves.
- Updated plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for
    `FolderPickerDialog`.
  - Added lint-related new-information note under Risk Controls.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Continue `T1.4/T1.6/T1.7` by moving another reusable dialog to
  `src/shared/ui/dialogs/*` (likely `ConfirmDialog`) with a legacy shim and
  canonical import updates, while applying the named `create/useModal` pattern.

## 2026-02-22 11:12:50 UTC

- Read `packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md` and `progress.txt`, then assessed the next Track 1 reusable dialog move.
- Selected `ConfirmDialog` as the next component to move into canonical shared UI placement.
- Performed full refactor with move-first workflow:
  - Used `git mv` to move
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/ConfirmDialog.tsx`
    -> `src/shared/ui/dialogs/ConfirmDialog.tsx`.
  - Added compatibility shim at legacy path:
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/ConfirmDialog.tsx`.
  - Updated canonical callsite/export usage:
    `src/components/dialogs/index.ts` now re-exports `ConfirmDialog` from
    `@/shared/ui/dialogs/ConfirmDialog`.
- New information discovered and handled:
  - Shared dialogs still must avoid NiceModal default import under current lint
    rules.
  - Updated moved `ConfirmDialog` to named imports
    (`create`, `useModal`) from `@ebay/nice-modal-react`.
  - Confirmed this dialog is primarily consumed through the dialogs barrel,
    so barrel-level canonicalization is an effective low-conflict callsite
    update pattern for Track 1.
- Updated plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for
    `ConfirmDialog`.
  - Added a new-information note about barrel-driven callsite updates.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Continue `T1.4/T1.6/T1.7` by moving the next reusable dialog candidate under
  `src/components/dialogs/shared/*` to `src/shared/ui/dialogs/*`, or start
  `T1.5` by converging duplicate `RebaseDialog` implementations.

## 2026-02-22 11:15:29 UTC

- Read `packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md` and `progress.txt`, then assessed the next low-risk reusable dialog move for Track 1.

- Performed full refactor with move-first workflow:
  - Used `git mv` to move
    `src/components/dialogs/wysiwyg/ImagePreviewDialog.tsx`
    -> `src/shared/ui/dialogs/ImagePreviewDialog.tsx`.
  - Added compatibility shim at legacy path:
    `src/components/dialogs/wysiwyg/ImagePreviewDialog.tsx`.
  - Updated canonical callsite import:
    `src/components/ui/wysiwyg.tsx` now imports
    `@/shared/ui/dialogs/ImagePreviewDialog`.
- New information discovered and handled:
  - Shared dialog lint restriction still requires avoiding NiceModal default import.
  - Updated moved dialog to use named imports from `@ebay/nice-modal-react`
    (`create`, `useModal`) in the canonical shared path.
  - Confirmed the migration pattern also applies to reusable dialogs that
    originated outside `components/dialogs/shared/*` (e.g. `wysiwyg`).
- Updated plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for
    `ImagePreviewDialog`.
  - Added a risk-controls note documenting this broader reusable-dialog
    migration pattern.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Continue `T1.4/T1.6/T1.7` for any remaining reusable dialogs, then begin
  `T1.5` by consolidating duplicate `RebaseDialog` implementations into one
  canonical dialog with compatibility exports.
