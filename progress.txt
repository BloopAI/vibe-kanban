- Read `packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md` and assessed the next low-risk Track 1 component migration.
- Selected `LoginRequiredPrompt` as the next reusable dialog-surface component to move into canonical shared UI placement.
- Performed full refactor with move-first workflow:
  - Used `git mv` to move
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/LoginRequiredPrompt.tsx`
    -> `src/shared/ui/dialogs/LoginRequiredPrompt.tsx`.
  - Added compatibility shim at legacy path:
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/LoginRequiredPrompt.tsx`.
  - Updated callsite to canonical path:
    `src/features/kanban/ui/ProjectKanban.tsx` now imports
    `@/shared/ui/dialogs/LoginRequiredPrompt`.
- Updated Track 1 plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for this migration.
  - Added new-information note documenting the single cross-scope callsite in
    `features/kanban` and why it was updated.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Continue `T1.4/T1.6/T1.7` with another reusable dialog migration in Track 1,
  preferably `ConfirmDialog` into `src/shared/ui/dialogs/*` with a legacy shim
  and canonical import updates.

## 2026-02-22 11:09:52 UTC

- Read `packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md` and `progress.txt`, then assessed the next reusable dialog migration in Track 1.
- Selected `FolderPickerDialog` as the next low-risk component to move into canonical shared UI placement.
- Performed full refactor with move-first workflow:
  - Used `git mv` to move
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/FolderPickerDialog.tsx`
    -> `src/shared/ui/dialogs/FolderPickerDialog.tsx`.
  - Added compatibility shim at legacy path:
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/FolderPickerDialog.tsx`.
  - Updated all direct callsites to canonical import path:
    - `src/components/ui-new/containers/CreateModeRepoPickerBar.tsx`
    - `src/components/ui-new/dialogs/settings/GeneralSettingsSection.tsx`
- New information discovered and handled:
  - After move, ESLint rejected NiceModal default import in `shared/ui/dialogs`.
  - Fixed by switching `FolderPickerDialog` to named imports from
    `@ebay/nice-modal-react` (`create`, `useModal`) rather than default import.
  - Documented this constraint in the Track 1 plan for subsequent shared dialog moves.
- Updated plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for
    `FolderPickerDialog`.
  - Added lint-related new-information note under Risk Controls.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Continue `T1.4/T1.6/T1.7` by moving another reusable dialog to
  `src/shared/ui/dialogs/*` (likely `ConfirmDialog`) with a legacy shim and
  canonical import updates, while applying the named `create/useModal` pattern.

## 2026-02-22 11:12:50 UTC

- Performed full refactor with move-first workflow:
  - Used `git mv` to move
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/ConfirmDialog.tsx`
    -> `src/shared/ui/dialogs/ConfirmDialog.tsx`.
  - Added compatibility shim at legacy path:
    `src/components/dialogs/shared/ConfirmDialog.tsx`.
  - Updated canonical callsite/export usage:
    `src/components/dialogs/index.ts` now re-exports `ConfirmDialog` from
    `@/shared/ui/dialogs/ConfirmDialog`.
- New information discovered and handled:
  - Shared dialogs still must avoid NiceModal default import under current lint
    rules.
  - Updated moved `ConfirmDialog` to named imports
    (`create`, `useModal`) from `@ebay/nice-modal-react`.
  - Confirmed this dialog is primarily consumed through the dialogs barrel,
    so barrel-level canonicalization is an effective low-conflict callsite
    update pattern for Track 1.
- Updated plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for

- New information discovered and handled:
  - Shared dialog lint restriction still requires avoiding NiceModal default import.
  - Updated moved dialog to use named imports from `@ebay/nice-modal-react`
    (`create`, `useModal`) in the canonical shared path.
  - Confirmed the migration pattern also applies to reusable dialogs that
    originated outside `components/dialogs/shared/*` (e.g. `wysiwyg`).
- Updated plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for

    `@/features/command-bar/ui/dialogs/CreatePRDialog` in:
    - `src/components/ui-new/actions/index.ts`
    - `src/components/dialogs/index.ts`
- New information discovered and handled:
  - Feature-path lint rules rejected direct imports from another
    `@/features/**` module (`GhCliSetupDialog`).
  - Updated the moved dialog to consume `GhCliSetupDialog` through its existing
    compatibility path (`@/components/dialogs/auth/GhCliSetupDialog`) to keep
    Track 1 low-risk and lint-clean.
  - Updated the moved dialog to use named NiceModal imports (`create`,

## 2026-02-22 11:48:00 UTC

- Read `packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md` and `progress.txt`,
  then assessed the next Track 1 migration with minimal conflict risk.
- Selected the workspace-scoped `RebaseDialog` (previously under
  `src/components/ui-new/dialogs`) as the next component to move into
  feature-owned UI placement.
- Performed full refactor with move-first workflow:
  - Used `git mv` to move
    `src/components/ui-new/dialogs/RebaseDialog.tsx`
    -> `src/features/command-bar/ui/dialogs/RebaseDialog.tsx`.
  - Added compatibility shim at legacy path:
    `src/components/ui-new/dialogs/RebaseDialog.tsx`.
  - Updated canonical callsite import to
    `@/features/command-bar/ui/dialogs/RebaseDialog` in:
    - `src/components/ui-new/actions/index.ts`
- New information discovered and handled:
  - Feature-owned dialog files still require named NiceModal imports outside
    the legacy exception paths, so the moved file now uses `create`/`useModal`.
  - After moving into command-bar feature ownership, `ResolveConflictsDialog`
    import had to be rewritten from relative path to
    `@/components/ui-new/dialogs/ResolveConflictsDialog`.
  - Duplicate `RebaseDialog` concepts are not yet fully mergeable because
    their prop/result contracts differ between workspace-flow and
    task-toolbar-flow variants.
- Updated Track 1 plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Recorded this as a completed `T1.5` consolidation step.
  - Marked the legacy shim under `T1.6`.
  - Marked canonical `ui-new/actions` import under `T1.7`.
  - Added a risk-controls note documenting the contract split between the two
    `RebaseDialog` implementations.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Continue `T1.5` by deciding whether to keep `src/components/dialogs/tasks/RebaseDialog.tsx`
  as a distinct task-toolbar dialog or introduce a shared internal primitive
  that both rebase dialog entrypoints consume.

## 2026-02-22 11:50:41 UTC

- Read `packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md` and `progress.txt`,
  then assessed the next safe Track 1 dialog migration.
- Selected `OAuthDialog` as the next feature-owned dialog move.

    - `src/components/ui-new/dialogs/settings/OrganizationsSettingsSection.tsx`
    - `src/components/ui-new/dialogs/settings/RemoteProjectsSettingsSection.tsx`
- New information discovered and handled:
  - Feature-path lint rules required replacing NiceModal default import with
    named imports (`create`, `useModal`) in the moved file.
  - Feature-path lint rules also required replacing direct provider import with
    hook-facade import (`@/hooks/useUserSystem`).
  - Non-owned/shared/lib callsites (`features/onboarding`,
    `features/migration`, `shared/ui/dialogs/LoginRequiredPrompt`,
    `lib/auth/tokenManager`) remain on the legacy path by design because those
    layers cannot import from `@/features/**` under current boundaries.
- Updated Track 1 plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for
    `OAuthDialog`.
  - Added a risk-controls note documenting why some OAuth callsites stay on
    shim imports until final consolidation.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Continue `T1.5` by evaluating whether remaining task-surface git dialogs
  (`ChangeTargetBranchDialog`, task `RebaseDialog`) should stay task-specific
  or be wrapped around shared primitives for final consolidation.

- New information discovered and handled:
  - Feature-path lint rules required replacing NiceModal default import with
    named imports (`create`, `useModal`) in the moved file.
  - Shared app layout continues to consume this dialog through the
    `components/dialogs` barrel, so barrel canonicalization remains a
    low-conflict update pattern for Track 1.

  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for
    `CreateOrganizationDialog`.
  - Added a risk-controls note for organization dialog migration pattern.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`

### Next change

- Continue Track 1 dialog consolidation by moving
  `src/components/dialogs/org/CreateRemoteProjectDialog.tsx` into
  `src/features/settings/ui/dialogs/*` with a compatibility shim and canonical
  settings/barrel import updates.

## 2026-02-22 11:55:42 UTC

- Read `packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md` and `progress.txt`,
  then assessed the next low-risk Track 1 dialog move.

- Performed full refactor with move-first workflow:
  - Used `git mv` to move
    `src/components/dialogs/org/CreateRemoteProjectDialog.tsx`
    -> `src/features/settings/ui/dialogs/CreateRemoteProjectDialog.tsx`.
  - Added compatibility shim at legacy path:
    `src/components/dialogs/org/CreateRemoteProjectDialog.tsx`.
  - Updated canonical callsites/import surfaces to
    `@/features/settings/ui/dialogs/CreateRemoteProjectDialog` in:
    - `src/components/ui-new/dialogs/settings/RemoteProjectsSettingsSection.tsx`
    - `src/components/dialogs/index.ts`
- New information discovered and handled:
  - Feature-path lint rules required replacing NiceModal default import with
    named imports (`create`, `useModal`) in the moved file.
  - Shared app layout continues to consume this dialog through the
    `components/dialogs` barrel, so barrel canonicalization remains the
    low-conflict import path for cross-surface usage in Track 1.
- Updated Track 1 plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for

    named imports (`create`, `useModal`) in the moved file.
  - This dialog is only consumed by one settings surface, so it did not require
    a `components/dialogs` barrel canonical export update.
- Updated Track 1 plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.parallel-1-ui-dialogs.md`):
  - Marked completed sub-steps under `T1.4`, `T1.6`, and `T1.7` for
