# Progress Log

## 2026-02-22 10:21:54 UTC

- Reviewed `packages-web-cutover-plan.md` and selected the next actionable Phase A task.
- Implemented Phase A foundations:
  - Added layer aliases in `packages/web/tsconfig.json` for `@/app/*`, `@/pages/*`, `@/widgets/*`, `@/features/*`, `@/entities/*`, `@/shared/*`, `@/integrations/*`.
  - Added matching Vite aliases in `packages/web/vite.config.ts`.
  - Added ESLint layer-boundary rules in `packages/web/.eslintrc.cjs` for `widgets`, `features`, `entities`, `shared`, and `integrations` paths.
- Updated plan status in `packages-web-cutover-plan.md`:
  - Marked Phase A alias + import-boundary tasks complete.
  - Marked Phase A as in progress (2/4 complete).
  - Clarified that the legacy-folder freeze should be enforced via a CI guard script.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Implement Phase A compatibility/guardrails:
  1. Add temporary compatibility re-export shims for first moved modules.
  2. Add CI guard script to block net-new files under `src/components/ui-new` and `src/components/dialogs`.

## 2026-02-22 10:25:23 UTC

- Assessed next Phase A item and implemented the legacy-path freeze guard.
- Added CI/local guard command:
  - New script: `scripts/check-legacy-frontend-paths.sh`
  - New npm script: `web:legacy-path-guard`
- Added allowlist baseline for currently tracked legacy files:
  - `scripts/legacy-frontend-paths-allowlist.txt`
- Wired guard into CI frontend checks in `.github/workflows/test.yml`.
  - Added script + allowlist to frontend path filters.
  - Added guard command into concurrent frontend check commands.
- New information discovered and handled:
  - Base-branch diff was not reliable yet because branch/main legacy trees are not aligned.
  - Switched guard strategy to committed allowlist baseline for stable enforcement.
- Updated plan (`packages-web-cutover-plan.md`):
  - Kept Phase A at 3/4 complete.
  - Marked legacy freeze task complete with script + allowlist + CI wiring details.
  - Documented allowlist rationale.
- Quality checks run:
  - `pnpm run format`
  - `pnpm run web:check`
  - `pnpm run web:lint`
  - `pnpm run web:legacy-path-guard`
  - All passed.

### Next change

- Implement remaining Phase A task:
  1. Add temporary compatibility re-export files for the first module moves in Phase B.
