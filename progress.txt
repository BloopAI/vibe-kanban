## Entries

- 2026-02-22 UTC - Reset all plan/progress files after merging parallel WIP
  branches; replaced with synchronized completion plans.
- 2026-02-22 14:54 UTC - Cross-track drift cleanup: removed
  `features/workspace-chat/model/hooks/**` dependency on
  `@/components/dialogs` barrel by switching restore-log dialog imports to
  `@/components/dialogs/tasks/RestoreLogsDialog`; normalized rebase dialog
  compatibility exports to explicit `BranchRebaseDialog` naming in
  `src/components/dialogs/index.ts` and
  `src/components/dialogs/tasks/RebaseDialog.tsx` to avoid ambiguous
  `RebaseDialog` contracts. Checks passed: `pnpm run format`,
  `pnpm run web:check`, `pnpm run web:lint`.
