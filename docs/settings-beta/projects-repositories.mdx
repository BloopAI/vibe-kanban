The Repositories tab allows you to configure scripts that run when a repository is used in workspaces.

### Accessing Repository Settings

1. Open **Settings** from the Workspaces navbar
2. Select the **Repositories** tab
3. Choose a repository from the dropdown to view and modify its settings

### General Settings

Configure basic repository information:

- **Display Name** - A friendly name for this repository
- **Repository Path** - The local path to the repository

### Scripts & Configuration

Configure dev server, setup, cleanup, and copy files for this repository. These scripts run whenever the repository is used in any workspace.

#### Dev Server Script

Command to start your development server (e.g., `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`).

<Tip>
Configure dev server scripts to enable the built-in preview browser in Workspaces.
</Tip>

#### Setup Script

Commands to run before starting work (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

Use this to ensure dependencies are installed and the environment is ready.

#### Cleanup Script

Commands to run when a workspace closes.

Use this for cleanup tasks like stopping background processes or removing temporary files.
