## Understanding Member Roles

### Member

Members can:
- Link their local projects to a remote project
- Share tasks with a project
- Create task attempts for tasks shared with them

### Admin

Administrators can do everything members can do, plus:
- Invite new members to the organisation
- Remove existing members
- Change member roles
- Manage pending invitations
- Delete the organisation (except personal organisations)

<Info>
Members cannot invite others or manage organisation settings. This keeps your team structure controlled.
</Info>

## Managing Pending Invitations

View all pending invitations in the **Pending Invitations** section of the Organization Settings page.

### Revoking an Invitation

If you need to revoke an invitation before it's accepted:

1. Locate the invitation in the Pending Invitations list
2. Click the **Revoke** button next to the invitation
3. The invitation link will be invalidated immediately

<Note>
Revoked invitations cannot be used, even if the recipient already received the email. You'll need to send a new invitation.
</Note>

## Managing Existing Members

### Viewing Members

The Members section displays all current organisation members with:
- Name and email

To update a member's role:

1. Find the member in the Members list
2. Click the role dropdown next to their name
3. Select the new role (Admin or Member)

To remove someone from the organisation:

## Accepting Invitations

When you invite someone, they'll receive an email with an invitation link. They just need to click it, log in with Google or GitHub, and accept the invitation to become a member of the organisation.
