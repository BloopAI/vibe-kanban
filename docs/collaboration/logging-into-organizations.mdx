Logging into an organisation enables team collaboration by making tasks visible to team members and controlling task assignment. While you can use Vibe Kanban locally without an account, logging in unlocks access to your personal organisation, the ability to create and join team organisations, and team member invitations and management.

## After Logging In

Once authenticated, you'll automatically be logged into your **personal organisation**. This is a default organisation created specifically for you on first login, named after you. It functions like any other organisation, but you cannot leave or delete it.
