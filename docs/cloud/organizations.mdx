Organisations are the top-level container in Vibe Kanban Cloud. They group your team members and projects together.

## What is an Organisation?

An **organisation** represents your team, company, or group. It contains:

- **Projects** - Your kanban boards for managing tasks
- **Members** - People who can access the organisation
- **Settings** - Configuration that applies to all projects


### Organisation Structure

An organisation acts as a container that holds two main things:

**Members** are the people who belong to your organisation. Each member has a role:
- **Admins** have full control - they can invite/remove members, change settings, and delete the organisation
- **Members** can work on all projects but cannot manage organisation settings

**Projects** are your kanban boards. Each project contains tasks, statuses, and tags. All members of an organisation can see and work on all projects within it.

<Tip>
Think of an organisation like a company: the company has employees (members) and departments or initiatives (projects). Everyone in the company can see what each department is working on.
</Tip>

## Creating an Organisation

### First-Time Setup

When you sign in for the first time, you'll automatically be prompted to create an organisation.


<Steps>
<Step title="Enter organisation name">
  Choose a name that represents your team or company. This will be visible to all members.

  **Good names:**
  - `Acme Engineering`

  - `My Company`

  **Avoid:**
  - Personal names (unless it's just for you)
  - Generic names like "Organisation 1"
</Step>

<Step title="Click Create">
  Click **Create Organisation** to finish. You'll be taken to your new organisation's dashboard.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="One org per team/company" icon="building">
  Create one organisation for your team or company. Don't create separate orgs for each project.
</Card>

<Card title="Use descriptive names" icon="tag">
  Choose organisation names that clearly identify the team. "Engineering" is better than "Org 1".
</Card>

<Card title="Have multiple admins" icon="users">
  Ensure at least two people are admins in case one leaves or is unavailable.
</Card>

<Card title="Regular member audits" icon="clipboard-check">
  Periodically review who has access and remove members who no longer need it.
</Card>
