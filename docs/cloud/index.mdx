## What is Vibe Kanban Cloud?

**Vibe Kanban Cloud** is a self-hosted version of Vibe Kanban designed for team collaboration. Instead of running Vibe Kanban as a local desktop application, you run it as a server that multiple team members can access.


### Key Differences from Local Vibe Kanban

| Feature | Local (Desktop) | Cloud |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **Users** | Single user | Multiple team members |
| **Data storage** | SQLite on your machine | PostgreSQL database |
| **Access** | Only on your computer | Anyone with the URL |
| **Authentication** | None needed | Sign in with GitHub/Google |
| **Collaboration** | Not supported | Real-time sync across users |
| **Setup** | `npx vibe-kanban` | Docker Compose stack |

### When to Use Cloud vs Local

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Use Local When" icon="user">
  - You're working solo
  - You want the simplest setup
  - You don't need to share with others
  - You want everything on your machine
</Card>

<Card title="Use Cloud When" icon="users">
  - You have a team working together
  - Multiple people need to see task progress
  - You want centralised project management
  - You need persistent data across machines
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

Vibe Kanban Cloud runs as a set of services on your machine (or a server) using Docker. When you start Vibe Kanban Cloud, four services work together to provide the full experience:

### The Four Services

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Frontend (What You See)" icon="browser">
The **frontend** is the web interface you interact with in your browser. It's built with React and provides all the visual elements - the kanban board, task panels, chat interface, and settings pages.

When you open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, you're loading this frontend application. It communicates with the backend to fetch and update data.

**Port:** 3000
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Backend API (The Brain)" icon="server">
The **backend** is a Rust server that handles all the logic and data operations. When you create a task, invite a team member, or sign in, the frontend sends a request to the backend, which processes it and updates the database.

The backend also handles:
- Authentication (verifying who you are)
- Authorisation (checking what you're allowed to do)
- Business logic (enforcing rules like "only admins can invite members")
- Communication with external services (GitHub, Google OAuth)

**Port:** 8081
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PostgreSQL (Data Storage)" icon="database">
**PostgreSQL** is an industry-standard database that stores all your data - organisations, projects, tasks, users, and everything else. Unlike the local version of Vibe Kanban (which uses SQLite), PostgreSQL is designed for multi-user access and can handle many simultaneous connections.

Your data persists in a Docker volume, so it survives container restarts. However, you should set up regular backups for production use.

**Port:** 5432
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Electric (Real-Time Sync)" icon="bolt">
**Electric** is the magic that makes real-time collaboration work. It watches the PostgreSQL database for changes and instantly pushes updates to all connected browsers.

When your teammate creates a task, Electric detects the database change and notifies your browser within milliseconds. This means you never need to refresh the page to see updates - they just appear.

Electric uses a technology called "logical replication" to efficiently stream only the changes, not the entire dataset.

**Port:** 3000 (shared with frontend proxy)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How They Work Together

<Steps>
<Step title="You open the app in your browser">
Your browser loads the frontend from `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend is a single-page application that runs entirely in your browser.
</Step>

<Step title="You sign in">
When you click "Sign in with GitHub", the frontend redirects you to GitHub. After you authorise, GitHub redirects back to the backend (`localhost:8081`), which creates your session and sends you back to the frontend with an authentication token.
</Step>

<Step title="The frontend connects to Electric">
Once signed in, the frontend establishes a persistent connection to Electric. This connection stays open, waiting for real-time updates.
</Step>

<Step title="You or a teammate makes a change">
When anyone creates a task, edits a project, or makes any change, the frontend sends the request to the backend API.
</Step>

<Step title="The backend updates the database">
The backend validates the request, applies business logic, and writes the change to PostgreSQL.
</Step>

<Step title="Electric broadcasts the change">
Electric detects the database change and immediately pushes it to all connected frontends - yours and your teammates'.
</Step>

<Step title="Everyone sees the update instantly">
All browsers receive the update and refresh their display. No one needs to manually refresh.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**What is Docker?**

Docker is a tool that packages applications into "containers" - self-contained environments with everything needed to run. Think of it like a shipping container: no matter what's inside, it works the same way everywhere.

You don't need to understand Docker deeply - just install it and run the commands we provide. Docker Compose (which we use) makes it easy to run multiple containers together with a single command.

## Features

### Team Collaboration

- **Organisations** - Group your team and projects together
- **Team members** - Invite colleagues via email
- **Role-based access** - Admins can manage settings; members can work on tasks
- **Real-time sync** - Changes appear instantly for all users

### Authentication

- **Sign in with GitHub** - Use your existing GitHub account

- Pull request creation
- Multiple agent support

## Current Limitations (Beta)

During beta, be aware of these limitations:

<Warning>
**Beta Limitations:**
- No automatic backups (set up your own PostgreSQL backups)
- Limited to self-hosted deployment (no managed cloud option yet)
- Some UI elements may change between versions
- Migration paths between versions may require manual steps
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Vibe Kanban Cloud, you'll need:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Docker Desktop** | Required to run the services |
| **GitHub or Google OAuth App** | For user authentication |
| **Basic terminal knowledge** | To run commands |

<Tip>
New to Docker? Don't worry - we'll walk you through installation step by step in the [Getting Started](/cloud/getting-started) guide.
