Vibe Kanban Cloud lets you collaborate with your team in real-time. Your data syncs to the cloud, so everyone sees the same projects, issues, and updates.

<Info>
**Already using Vibe Kanban locally?** Cloud uses the same interface you're familiar with. The difference is your data syncs to the cloud and you can invite team members.
</Info>

If you haven't already, start Vibe Kanban:

**Next steps:**

- [Learn the kanban board](/cloud/kanban-board) to manage tasks
- [Customise your board](/cloud/customisation) with columns and tags
- [Invite more team members](/cloud/team-members) to collaborate

## Signing Out

To sign out:
1. Click your profile avatar in the top corner
2. Click **Sign Out**

Your data remains safe in the cloud. Sign in again anytime to continue where you left off.

## Switching Between Local and Cloud

You can use both local projects and Cloud projects:

| Local Projects | Cloud Projects |
|----------------|----------------|
| Data stored on your machine | Data synced to cloud |
| Only you can access | Team members can collaborate |
| No sign-in required | Requires sign-in |
| Works offline | Requires internet connection |

Both appear in the same Vibe Kanban interface. Local projects show in one section, Cloud projects in another.
