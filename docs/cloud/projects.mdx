Projects are where your work lives. Each project contains a kanban board with issues, statuses, and tags that help you organise and track progress.

## What is a Project?

A **project** is a container for related work within your organisation. Think of it as a dedicated space for a specific initiative, product, or team goal.

Each project has:
- **Issues** - Individual work items (bugs, features, tasks)
- **Statuses** - Columns on your kanban board (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.)
- **Tags** - Labels for categorising issues
- **Team access** - All organisation members can view and work on project issues


## Creating a Project

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your organisation">
  Sign in and select your organisation from the sidebar or organisation switcher.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Create Project">
  Click the **+ New Project** button in the sidebar or on the projects page.

</Step>

<Step title="Enter project details">
  Fill in the project information:

  | Field | Description |
  |-------|-------------|
  | **Name** | A clear name for your project (e.g., "Mobile App", "Q1 Marketing") |
  | **Colour** | Choose a colour to identify this project in the sidebar |

</Step>

<Step title="Click Create">
  Click **Create** to create your project. You'll be taken to your new project's kanban board.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Default Statuses

New projects come with four default status columns:

| Status | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Backlog** | Issues waiting to be worked on |
| **To Do** | Issues ready to start |
| **In Progress** | Issues currently being worked on |
| **Done** | Completed issues |

You can customise these statuses - rename them, change colours, add new ones, or hide ones you don't use. See [Customising Your Board](/cloud/customisation) for details.

## Project Settings

Access project settings by clicking the gear icon (<Icon icon="gear" />) in the project header or through the command bar.


### Renaming a Project

2. Edit the **Project name** field
3. Click **Save**

### Changing Project Colour

**From the project dropdown:**

- Select a different project from the dropdown


## Deleting a Project

<Warning>
Deleting a project is permanent and cannot be undone. All issues, comments, and data within the project will be deleted.
</Warning>

To delete a project:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open project settings">
  Click the gear icon in the project header.
</Step>

<Step title="Scroll to Danger Zone">
  Find the **Danger Zone** section at the bottom.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Delete Project">
  Click **Delete Project** and confirm by typing the project name.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="One project per initiative" icon="folder">
  Create separate projects for distinct initiatives rather than putting everything in one project. This keeps your boards focused and manageable.
</Card>

<Card title="Use descriptive names" icon="tag">
  Choose project names that clearly describe what the project is about. "Mobile App v2" is better than "Project A".
</Card>

<Card title="Consistent status columns" icon="columns">
  Try to use similar status columns across projects so team members can switch between projects without confusion.
</Card>

<Card title="Archive completed work" icon="box-archive">
  Once issues are done, you can hide the Done column or create an Archive status to keep your board clean.
