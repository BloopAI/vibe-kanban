## Docker Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Docker command not found">
**Symptom:** Terminal shows `docker: command not found` or `docker is not recognized`

**Cause:** Docker is not installed or not in your system PATH.

**Solutions:**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS">
1. Download and install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Open Docker Desktop from Applications
3. Wait for it to start (whale icon stops animating)
4. Try the command again
</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">
1. Download and install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Restart your computer after installation

   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
   ```
2. Add your user to the docker group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
3. **Log out and back in** for the group change to take effect
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Docker daemon not running">
**Symptom:** Error message like `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon` or `Is the docker daemon running?`

**Cause:** Docker Desktop is installed but not running.

**Solutions:**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS">
1. Open Docker Desktop from Applications
2. Wait for the whale icon to appear in the menu bar
3. Wait until the whale stops animating (indicating Docker is ready)
</Tab>

   ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied when running Docker">
**Symptom:** Error like `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`

**Cause:** Your user doesn't have permission to access Docker (Linux only).

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in, then verify
groups  # Should show 'docker' in the list
```

<Warning>
You must **log out and log back in** for the group change to take effect. Just closing the terminal isn't enough.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Port already in use">
**Symptom:** Error like `port is already allocated` or `address already in use`

**Cause:** Another application is using port 3000, 5432, or 8081.

**Solutions:**

1. **Find what's using the port:**
   ```bash
   # Replace 3000 with the port number from the error
   lsof -i :3000        # macOS/Linux
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000  # Windows
   ```

2. **Stop the conflicting process**, or

3. **Change the port** in `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "3001:3000"  # Change 3000 to an available port
   ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Docker build fails">
**Symptom:** Build errors during `docker compose up --build`

**Possible causes:**
- Network issues downloading dependencies
- Insufficient disk space
- Corrupted Docker cache

**Solutions:**

1. **Retry the build** (network issues are often transient):
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```

2. **Clear Docker cache** and rebuild:
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```

3. **Check disk space:**
   ```bash
   df -h  # Should have at least 10GB free
   ```

<Warning>
`docker system prune -a` removes all unused images and containers. Only run this if you don't have other important Docker images.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Containers keep restarting">
**Symptom:** `docker ps` shows containers with status `Restarting` or they keep cycling.

**Cause:** A service is crashing, often due to missing configuration.

**Solution:**
1. Check the logs to find the error:
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml logs
   ```

2. Common causes:
   - Missing or invalid `VIBEKANBAN_REMOTE_JWT_SECRET`
   - Database connection issues
   - Invalid OAuth credentials
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Invalid redirect URI">
**Symptom:** OAuth provider shows "Invalid redirect URI" or "Redirect URI mismatch"

**Cause:** The callback URL in your OAuth app doesn't match what Vibe Kanban sends.

**Solution:**
1. Go to your OAuth app settings:
   - **GitHub:** [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers) → OAuth Apps
   - **Google:** [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) → Credentials

2. Verify the callback URL is **exactly**:
   - GitHub: `http://localhost:8081/v1/oauth/github/callback`
   - Google: `http://localhost:8081/v1/oauth/google/callback`

3. Check for:
   - No trailing slash
   - Correct port (8081)
   - `http://` not `https://` for localhost
   - Exact path spelling
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Access denied during sign-in">
**Symptom:** GitHub or Google shows "access denied" error

**Possible causes:**
- You clicked "Deny" instead of "Authorize"
- Your GitHub organisation has OAuth app restrictions
- The OAuth app has been suspended

**Solutions:**
1. Try again and click "Authorize" or "Allow"
2. If you're part of a GitHub organisation with restrictions, ask your admin to approve the app
3. Check the OAuth app status in your provider's settings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Signed in with wrong account">
**Symptom:** You're signed in as a different user than expected

**Cause:** Your browser is logged into a different GitHub/Google account.

**Solution:**
1. Sign out of Vibe Kanban
2. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) or [google.com](https://google.com)
3. Sign out there
4. Sign back in with the correct account
5. Return to Vibe Kanban and sign in
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Session keeps expiring">
**Symptom:** You're frequently being signed out

**Possible causes:**
- The server was restarted (invalidates all sessions)
- JWT secret was changed
- Token refresh is failing

**Solutions:**
1. Simply sign in again
2. If persistent:
   - Check if the server is stable (not restarting)
   - Verify `VIBEKANBAN_REMOTE_JWT_SECRET` hasn't changed
   - Check server logs for authentication errors
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connection Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Cannot connect to localhost:3000">
**Symptom:** Browser shows "This site can't be reached" or "Connection refused"

**Possible causes:**
- Docker containers aren't running
- Services are still starting
- Wrong URL

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify containers are running:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   You should see containers for `remote`, `electric`, and `postgres`.

2. **Wait for services to start** - first run can take several minutes.

3. **Check you're using the right URL:**
   - Use `http://localhost:3000` (not https)
   - Don't use `127.0.0.1` unless you've configured it

4. **Check container logs for errors:**
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml logs remote
   ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Page loads but nothing appears">
**Symptom:** The page loads but is blank or shows a loading spinner indefinitely

**Possible causes:**
- Electric sync service isn't ready
- JavaScript error in the browser
- API connection failing

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait a bit longer** - Electric needs to sync initial data

2. **Check browser console:**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
   - Look at the Console tab for errors

3. **Check Electric service:**
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml logs electric
   ```
   Look for "Electric is ready" message.

4. **Try a hard refresh:** Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes not syncing between users">
**Symptom:** Changes made by one user don't appear for others

**Possible causes:**
- Electric sync service issues
- WebSocket connection problems
- Browser extension blocking connections

**Solutions:**

1. **Refresh the page** - often resolves temporary sync issues

2. **Check Electric logs:**
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml logs electric
   ```

3. **Disable browser extensions** temporarily (especially ad blockers)

4. **Restart services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml restart
   ```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Database Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Database connection failed">
**Symptom:** Error logs mention "connection refused" or "database does not exist"

**Cause:** PostgreSQL container isn't running or isn't ready.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if PostgreSQL is running:**
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep postgres
   ```

2. **Check PostgreSQL logs:**
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml logs postgres
   ```

3. **Wait for PostgreSQL** to be ready - look for "database system is ready to accept connections"

4. **Restart all services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml down
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml up
   ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Migration errors">
**Symptom:** Errors about migrations or schema during startup

**Cause:** Database schema is out of sync, often after updates.

**Solutions:**

1. **For a fresh start** (destroys all data):
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml down -v
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```

2. **If you need to preserve data:**
   - Back up your database first
   - Check the release notes for migration instructions
   - Consider reaching out for support
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Configuration Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Environment variables not loading">
**Symptom:** Errors about missing configuration or variables being undefined

**Cause:** `.env.remote` file isn't being read or has issues.

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify file location:**
   `.env.remote` should be in the repository root, not in `crates/remote/`

2. **Check file contents:**
   ```bash
   cat .env.remote
   ```
   Ensure variables are set correctly without quotes around values.

3. **Verify you're using the right command:**
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml up
   ```
   Note: `--env-file .env.remote` is required.

4. **Check for typos** in variable names (they're case-sensitive).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Invalid JWT secret">
**Symptom:** Authentication errors or server won't start, mentioning JWT

**Cause:** `VIBEKANBAN_REMOTE_JWT_SECRET` is missing, empty, or not valid base64.

**Solution:**
1. Generate a new secret:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 48
   ```

2. Add to `.env.remote`:
   ```bash
   VIBEKANBAN_REMOTE_JWT_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here
   ```

3. Restart services:
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml down
   docker compose --env-file .env.remote -f crates/remote/docker-compose.yml up
   ```

<Warning>
Changing the JWT secret invalidates all existing sessions. Users will need to sign in again.
</Warning>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
