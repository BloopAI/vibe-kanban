Every team works differently. Customise your kanban board to match your workflow by adding columns, changing colours, renaming statuses, and controlling what's visible.

## Display Settings

Access display settings to customise your board columns:

1. Click the **Display Settings** button (<Icon icon="sliders" />) in the board header
2. The settings panel opens showing all your columns


## Managing Columns

<Step title="Save changes">
  Click **Save** to apply your changes. The new column appears on your board.

Hide columns you don't use regularly to keep your board clean:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Display Settings">
  Click the **Display Settings** button.

- Still exist - issues in them are preserved
- Can be viewed using the "All" status tab

<Info>
Hiding a column is useful for "Done" statuses. You can hide completed work to focus on active issues, but still access them when needed via the status tabs.

## Common Workflows

Here are some example column setups for different workflows:

### Simple Workflow

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| To Do | Work that needs to be done |
| In Progress | Currently being worked on |
| Done | Completed |

### Development Workflow

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Backlog | Future work, not yet prioritised |
| To Do | Ready to start |
| In Progress | Currently being developed |
| In Review | Waiting for code review |
| Done | Merged and complete |

### Support Workflow

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| New | Newly reported issues |
| Triaged | Reviewed and prioritised |
| In Progress | Being investigated/fixed |
| Waiting | Waiting for customer response |
| Resolved | Issue resolved |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Keep it simple" icon="circle-check">
  Start with fewer columns. You can always add more later. Too many columns creates confusion about where issues should go.
</Card>

<Card title="Use clear names" icon="tag">
  Column names should be obvious to everyone on the team. "In Progress" is clearer than "WIP" or "Active".
</Card>

<Card title="Hide, don't delete" icon="eye-slash">
  If you're not sure about a column, hide it instead of deleting. You can unhide it if you need it later.
</Card>

<Card title="Consistent colours" icon="palette">
  Use consistent colour meanings across projects. For example, always use red for blocked/urgent statuses.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can't delete a column">
The column probably has issues in it. You must move all issues to another column before deleting. Check:
1. The issue count in the column header
2. Hidden issues (use the "All" status tab to see them)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes didn't save">
Make sure you clicked **Save** after making changes in Display Settings. Changes aren't applied until you save.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Column order is wrong">
Open Display Settings and drag columns to reorder them. Remember to click **Save** after reordering.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't find a column">
It might be hidden. Open Display Settings and check the visibility toggle for each column. Or use the "All" status tab to see issues in hidden columns.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
