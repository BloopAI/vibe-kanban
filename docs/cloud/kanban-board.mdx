The kanban board is your primary view for managing work. Issues are organised into columns representing different stages of your workflow, and you can drag and drop them as work progresses.


## Board Layout

The kanban board consists of:

- **Filter Bar** - Search, filter, and sort your issues (top)
- **Status Columns** - Vertical columns representing workflow stages
- **Issue Cards** - Individual work items within columns
- **Column Headers** - Show status name and issue count

### Status Columns

Each column represents a status in your workflow. By default, projects have:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Backlog** | Ideas and future work |
| **To Do** | Ready to start |
| **In Progress** | Currently being worked on |
| **Done** | Completed |

You can [customise these columns](/cloud/customisation) - add new ones, rename them, change colours, or hide ones you don't use.

### Issue Cards

Each card shows key information at a glance:

- **Simple ID** - The issue identifier (e.g., TASK-123)
- **Title** - What needs to be done
- **Priority** - Colour-coded indicator (if set)
- **Assignees** - Avatar(s) of assigned team members
- **Tags** - Coloured labels (if any)


Click any card to open the full [issue panel](/cloud/issues).

## Drag and Drop

Move issues between columns and reorder them within columns using drag and drop.

### Moving Between Columns

To change an issue's status:

1. Click and hold an issue card
2. Drag it to the target column
3. Release to drop it


The issue's status updates immediately, and all team members see the change in real-time.

### Reordering Within a Column

To change the order of issues within a column:

1. Make sure you're in **Manual** sort mode (check the sort dropdown in the filter bar)
2. Click and hold an issue card
3. Drag it up or down within the same column
4. Release to drop it in the new position

<Info>
Reordering only works when sort mode is set to **Manual**. If you're sorting by Priority, Created, or another field, the order is determined automatically and you can't drag to reorder.
</Info>

### Drag Indicators

While dragging, you'll see visual feedback:

- **Cursor changes** - Shows you're in drag mode
- **Drop target** - Highlights where the card will land
- **Card shadow** - Shows the card being moved

## Views

The board supports multiple views for different ways of looking at your work.

### Board View (Default)

The traditional kanban layout with columns. Best for:
- Seeing work in progress at a glance
- Moving issues through your workflow
- Daily standups and team coordination

### List View

A tabular view showing issues in rows. Best for:
- Reviewing many issues quickly
- Bulk operations
- Detailed filtering and sorting


To switch views, click the view toggle in the top-right corner of the board.

### Status Tabs

Above the board, tabs let you filter by status visibility:

| Tab | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| **Active** | Issues in visible (non-hidden) status columns |
| **All** | All issues including those in hidden columns |
| **[Hidden Status]** | Issues in a specific hidden column |


This is useful when you've hidden completed statuses (like Done) but occasionally need to see them.

## Working with the Board

### Opening an Issue

Click any issue card to open the issue panel on the right side of the screen. The panel shows full details and lets you edit the issue.

### Quick Status Change

Instead of opening an issue, you can change its status by dragging it to another column. This is the fastest way to update many issues.

### Keyboard Navigation

Use keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `↑` `↓` | Move between issues |
| `Enter` | Open selected issue |
| `Escape` | Close issue panel |

## Real-Time Collaboration

The board updates in real-time as team members make changes:

- **Issue moved** - Cards animate to their new position
- **Issue created** - New cards appear automatically
- **Issue updated** - Changes to titles, priorities, etc. appear instantly
- **Issue deleted** - Cards disappear from the board

You don't need to refresh the page - everything syncs automatically.

<Info>
If you and a teammate move the same issue at the same time, the last action wins. The board will show the final position after both actions complete.
</Info>

## Empty Columns

Columns with no issues show an empty state. You can:

- Drag issues into empty columns
- Use the **+** button to create a new issue in that column
- [Hide empty columns](/cloud/customisation) to reduce visual clutter

## Column Count Badges

Each column header shows a count of issues in that column. This helps you quickly see:

- Where work is piling up
- Which stages are empty
- Overall distribution of work


## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Limit work in progress" icon="gauge-high">
  Don't have too many issues in "In Progress". It's better to finish work than to start new work. Consider adding WIP limits to your process.
</Card>

<Card title="Review regularly" icon="calendar-check">
  Use the board in daily standups to review what's in progress and identify blockers. The visual layout makes status updates quick.
</Card>

<Card title="Keep columns meaningful" icon="columns">
  Each column should represent a real stage in your workflow. If issues skip a column, you probably don't need it.
</Card>

<Card title="Use filters for focus" icon="filter">
  When the board gets busy, use filters to focus on what matters - your assigned issues, high priority items, or specific tags.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I can't reorder issues within a column">
Make sure you're in **Manual** sort mode. Click the sort dropdown in the filter bar and select "Manual". If you're sorting by Priority, Created, or another field, the order is fixed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Issues aren't appearing">
Check your filters - you might have active filters hiding some issues. Click **Clear All** in the filter bar to reset filters and see all issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="A column is missing">
The column might be hidden. Go to [Display Settings](/cloud/customisation) and check if the status is set to hidden. Toggle it back to visible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes aren't saving">
Check your internet connection. The board requires an active connection to sync changes. If you're offline, changes won't be saved until you reconnect.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
