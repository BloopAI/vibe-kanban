## Install

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

Starts a local server and opens in your browser. No accounts, no config files.

<Info>
**Requires Node.js** (LTS recommended). To use a specific port: `PORT=8080 npx vibe-kanban`
</Info>

## Onboarding

On first launch you'll see a sign-in screen with two options: **Continue with GitHub** or **Continue with Google**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/onboarding-sign-in.png" alt="Vibe Kanban onboarding screen showing Sign in to continue with GitHub and Google buttons" />
</Frame>


<Info>
If you want to skip sign-in for now, click **More options** → **I understand, continue without signing in**. You'll still be able to create workspaces, but the kanban board, issues, and team features require an account. You can sign in later from the sidebar.
</Info>

Vibe Kanban doesn't have its own AI — it orchestrates agents you already have installed. You need at least one authenticated before you start:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Claude Code">
```bash
npx -y @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Follow the login prompts. Requires an Anthropic API key or a Claude Max/Team subscription. [Full guide →](/agents/claude-code)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Codex">
```bash
npx -y @openai/codex
```

Follow the login prompts, or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use the API directly. [Full guide →](/agents/openai-codex)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Gemini CLI">
```bash
npx -y @google/gemini-cli
```

Authenticates via Google OAuth on first run. [Full guide →](/agents/gemini-cli)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Other agents">
Vibe Kanban also supports **GitHub Copilot**, **Amp**, **Cursor Agent CLI**, **OpenCode**, **Droid**, **Claude Code Router**, and **Qwen Code**.

</Tabs>

## Sign in

If you signed in during onboarding, you're already set — a personal organisation and an **Initial Project** are created automatically. You can [create a team organisation](/cloud/organizations) and [invite members](/cloud/team-members) later.

If you skipped sign-in, you can sign in any time by clicking **Sign in** in the bottom-left of the sidebar.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/sidebar-sign-in-button.png" alt="Workspace sidebar showing the Sign in button in the bottom-left corner" />
</Frame>

[Sign in](/cloud/authentication) with GitHub or Google.

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/cloud/sign-in-dialog.png" alt="Sign in dialog with GitHub and Google options" />
</Frame>

---

## Create an issue

Click **+** on any column of the [kanban board](/cloud/kanban-board) to [create an issue](/cloud/issues). Set a title, description, priority, and assignee.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/issue-overview.png" alt="Issue creation panel with title, description, priority, and a toggle to create a workspace immediately" />
</Frame>

There's a toggle — **Create draft workspace immediately** — that creates the issue and opens a workspace for it at the same time. If you leave it off, you can attach a workspace later from the issue detail view.

---

## Create a workspace

Click the **+** button in the sidebar. Pick a project and add your git repositories.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspaces-create-new.png" alt="Create workspace dialog showing project selection, repository list, and task input" />
</Frame>

Vibe Kanban creates a [git worktree](/workspaces/git-operations) — a separate directory with its own branch, completely isolated from your main branch and from every other workspace. Choose an agent from the dropdown, describe what you want, and click **Create**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspaces-agent-selection.png" alt="Agent selection dropdown showing available coding agents" />
</Frame>

The agent starts working immediately. You can watch the conversation in real time.

</Frame>

## Set setup and cleanup scripts

Before the agent starts coding, you probably want dependencies installed. And when a workspace closes, you might want to stop background processes or run a formatter.

Open **Settings** → **Repositories** tab, select your repository, and configure:

- **Setup script** — runs before the agent starts (e.g., `npm install`)
- **Cleanup script** — runs when the workspace closes (e.g., `npx prettier --write .`)
- **Dev server script** — starts your dev server for the [preview panel](/workspaces/preview) (e.g., `npm run dev`)

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/settings-repositories.png" alt="Repository settings showing dev server, setup, and cleanup script configuration" />
</Frame>

[Full scripts guide →](/settings/projects-repositories)

---

## Start a dev server

If you've configured a dev server script, click the **Play** icon in the context bar or use the [command bar](/workspaces/command-bar) (`Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Toggle Dev Server"). The [preview panel](/workspaces/preview) opens automatically and your application loads in a built-in browser.

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "400px"}} src="/images/workspaces-preview-panel.png" alt="Workspace showing preview panel with built-in browser displaying the application" />
</Frame>

If no dev server script is configured yet, the preview panel shows a setup prompt — click **Edit Dev Server Script**, enter your command, and hit **Save and Test**.

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/workspaces-fix-dev-script.png" alt="Fix Dev Server Script dialog with script input field and Save and Test button" />
</Frame>

---

## Review code

As the agent writes code, the [**Changes** panel](/workspaces/changes) updates with syntax-highlighted diffs — every file modified, every line added or removed.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspaces-changes-panel.png" alt="Changes panel showing syntax-highlighted diffs with a file tree" />
</Frame>

Hover over any line to reveal a comment icon. Click it, type what's wrong, and the agent reads your comment and adjusts its code. You can go back and forth as many times as you need.

<Frame caption="Inline comments on diffs — the agent reads these and updates its code">
  <img src="/images/workspaces-inline-comments.png" alt="Code diff with an inline review comment dialog" />
</Frame>

When the code looks right, click **Open pull request** in the [Git panel](/workspaces/git-operations). Your main branch was never touched — if you spot something later, go back to the conversation and keep iterating.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspaces-create-pr.png" alt="Open pull request dialog showing branch and title" />
</Frame>

<Info>
Pull requests use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). If `gh` isn't installed, Vibe Kanban prompts you to set it up.

## Safety

Agents run with full autonomous permissions (each agent's equivalent of `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or `--yolo`).

- **Worktree isolation** — each workspace is a separate git directory with its own branch. Agents cannot modify your main branch or other workspaces.
- **You review everything** — nothing gets merged until you click **Open pull request**.
- **Agents can run system commands** — they install packages, start dev servers, and run tests. They run with your user permissions.

<Warning>
Agents operate with the same system permissions as your user account. They can run arbitrary shell commands. Always review agent work before merging.
</Warning>
