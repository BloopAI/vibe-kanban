## Install and launch

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

Vibe Kanban starts a local server and opens in your browser. No accounts, no sign-ups, no config files.

<Info>
**Requires Node.js** (LTS recommended). To pin a port: `PORT=8080 npx vibe-kanban`
</Info>

## Connect a coding agent

Vibe Kanban orchestrates coding agents you already have. You need at least one installed and authenticated before creating a workspace.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Claude Code">
```bash
npx -y @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Follow the login prompts. Requires an Anthropic API key or a Claude Max/Team subscription. [Full guide →](/agents/claude-code)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Codex">
```bash
npx -y @openai/codex
```

Follow the login prompts, or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use the API directly. [Full guide →](/agents/openai-codex)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Gemini CLI">
```bash
npx -y @google/gemini-cli
```

Authenticates via Google OAuth on first run. [Full guide →](/agents/gemini-cli)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Other agents">
Vibe Kanban also supports **GitHub Copilot**, **Amp**, **Cursor Agent CLI**, **OpenCode**, **Droid**, **Claude Code Router**, and **Qwen Code**.

## Your first task — describe, review, ship

A workspace is an isolated environment for a single task. It gets its own git branch, its own worktree, and its own conversation with an agent. Your main branch is never touched.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a workspace">
  Click the **+** button in the sidebar. Give your workspace a name and select a project with at least one repository.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/workspaces-create-new.png" alt="Create workspace dialog showing name field and project selection" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Pick an agent">
  Select which coding agent to use. You can switch agents later or run multiple sessions with different agents in the same workspace.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/workspaces-agent-selection.png" alt="Agent selection dropdown showing available coding agents" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Describe your task">
  Type what you want in plain English. Be specific or be vague — the agent will ask clarifying questions if needed.

  ```
  Add a dark mode toggle to the navbar. Use the existing
  Tailwind dark: classes. Store the preference in localStorage.
  ```

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/workspaces-conversation.png" alt="Workspace conversation showing a task description and the agent's response" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Review the changes">
  As the agent works, changes appear in the **Changes** panel with full syntax-highlighted diffs. Hover over any line to reveal a comment icon — click it to leave feedback, and the agent adjusts.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/workspaces-inline-comments.png" alt="Code diff with inline review comments and feedback dialog" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a pull request">
  When you're satisfied, click **Open pull request** in the Git panel. Your main branch was never modified.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/workspaces-create-pr.png" alt="Create pull request dialog" />
  </Frame>

  <Info>
  Pull requests use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). If `gh` isn't installed, Vibe Kanban will prompt you to set it up.
  </Info>
</Step>
</Steps>

That's the full loop: **describe → review → ship**.

## Add your team with Cloud

Everything above works locally for a single developer. Cloud adds team collaboration: shared projects, a kanban board, issues with IDs, and real-time sync.

<Steps>
<Step title="Sign in">
  Click **Login** in the sidebar and sign in with GitHub or Google. A personal organisation is created automatically.

  <Frame>
    <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/cloud/sign-in-dialog.png" alt="Sign in dialog with GitHub and Google options" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a project">
  Click **+ New Project** in the sidebar. This creates a kanban board with customisable status columns.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/cloud/project-kanban-board.png" alt="Kanban board with To do, In progress, In review, and Done columns" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Create issues and start working">
  Click **+** on any column to create an issue. Set a title, description, priority, and assignee. Toggle **Create draft workspace immediately** to jump straight into a workspace.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/cloud/issue-overview.png" alt="Issue creation panel alongside the kanban board" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Invite your team (optional)">
  Create a new organisation from the user menu, then invite members by email. Everyone sees the same board and can spin up workspaces on any issue.

  <Frame>
    <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/cloud/invite-member-dialog.png" alt="Invite team member dialog" />
  </Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Safety model

Vibe Kanban runs agents with full autonomous permissions (each agent's equivalent of `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or `--yolo`) so they can work without constant approval prompts. This is safe because:

1. **Git worktree isolation** — each workspace operates on its own branch in a separate directory. Agents cannot modify your main branch or other workspaces.
2. **You review everything** — nothing is merged until you explicitly create a pull request.
3. **Agents can still run system commands** — they may install packages, start dev servers, or run tests. Review their output and keep backups of anything critical.

<Warning>
Agents operate with the same system permissions as your user account. They can run arbitrary shell commands. Always review agent work before merging.
</Warning>
