## Supported Systems

We build and test Vibe Kanban on the following systems:

- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux
- Windows

## Prerequisites

Before installing Vibe Kanban, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**: Latest LTS version recommended
- **Coding agent authentication**: Authenticate with your preferred coding agents outside of Vibe Kanban

**No API keys required!** All core features work without any API keys or environment variables. Optional features like task sharing and analytics can be configured later.

## Safety Notice

<Warning>
Vibe Kanban runs AI agents with --dangerously-skip-permissions/--yolo flags by default so they can work autonomously without constant approval prompts. Each task runs in an isolated git worktree, preventing agents from interfering with each other.
Agents can still perform system-level actions, so review their work and keep backups.
</Warning>

## Installation & Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Authenticate with a coding agent">
  Before launching Vibe Kanban, ensure you're authenticated with at least one [supported coding agent](/supported-coding-agents). Follow the installation and authentication instructions for your preferred agent.
</Step>

<Step title="Install and launch Vibe Kanban">
  Open a terminal and run:

  ```bash
  npx vibe-kanban
  ```

  <Check>
  The application will bind to a random free port, print the URL in the terminal, and automatically open in your default browser.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Complete initial setup">
  Complete the setup dialogs to configure your coding agent and editor preferences. GitHub authentication is optional and can be configured later.
</Step>

<Step title="Create your first project">
  You'll land on the Projects page, populated with your three most recently active git projects if automatically discovered. Click "Create project" to add more projects.
</Step>

<Step title="Add tasks">
  Start tracking your work by [creating tasks](/core-features/creating-tasks) within your project.
</Step>

<Step title="Optional: Configure GitHub integration">
  Connect to GitHub in [Settings](/configuration-customisation/global-settings) to enable branch management and pull request creation.
</Step>

<Step title="Optional: Set up MCP integration">
  Streamline task creation with coding agents by [setting up MCP integration](/integrations/vibe-kanban-mcp-server).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To use a fixed port, specify the `PORT` environment variable: `PORT=8080 npx vibe-kanban`
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Clerk Authentication Warning

If you see a warning about `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` not being set, this is expected and safe to ignore. This key is only needed for **task sharing** features, which allow you to share tasks with team members. All other features work without it.

To enable task sharing:

1. Create environment files from templates:
   ```bash
   pnpm run setup:env
   ```
2. Get your Clerk publishable key from [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
3. Add it to `frontend/.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   ```

See the [API Key Requirements documentation](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/blob/main/API_KEY_REQUIREMENTS.md) for complete setup instructions.

### Other Console Warnings

Console warnings about missing `POSTHOG_API_KEY` or similar environment variables are also safe to ignore. These are for optional analytics and advanced features.
