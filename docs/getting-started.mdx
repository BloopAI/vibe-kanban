## Install

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

Starts a local server and opens in your browser. No accounts, no config files.

<Info>
**Requires Node.js** (LTS recommended). To use a specific port: `PORT=8080 npx vibe-kanban`
</Info>

## Connect a coding agent

Vibe Kanban doesn't have its own AI — it orchestrates agents you already have installed. You need at least one:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Claude Code">
```bash
npx -y @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Follow the login prompts. Requires an Anthropic API key or a Claude Max/Team subscription. [Full guide →](/agents/claude-code)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Codex">
```bash
npx -y @openai/codex
```

Follow the login prompts, or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use the API directly. [Full guide →](/agents/openai-codex)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Gemini CLI">
```bash
npx -y @google/gemini-cli
```

Authenticates via Google OAuth on first run. [Full guide →](/agents/gemini-cli)
</Tab>

<Tab title="Other agents">
Vibe Kanban also supports **GitHub Copilot**, **Amp**, **Cursor Agent CLI**, **OpenCode**, **Droid**, **Claude Code Router**, and **Qwen Code**.

## Your first task

### Create a workspace

Click the **+** button in the sidebar. Pick a project with at least one git repository.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspaces-create-new.png" alt="Create workspace dialog showing name field and project selection" />
</Frame>

Behind the scenes, Vibe Kanban creates a [git worktree](/workspaces/git-operations) — a separate directory with its own branch. The agent works here, completely isolated from your main branch. If you don't like what it produces, you [delete the worktree](/workspaces/managing-workspaces) and your repo is exactly as it was.

### Pick an agent and describe your task

Choose an agent from the dropdown, then describe what you want in plain language. [See all supported agents →](/supported-coding-agents)

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspaces-agent-selection.png" alt="Agent selection dropdown showing available coding agents" />
</Frame>

```
Add a dark mode toggle to the navbar. Use the existing
Tailwind dark: classes. Store the preference in localStorage.
```

The agent reads your prompt and starts coding. You can watch it work in real time.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspaces-conversation.png" alt="Workspace conversation showing a task description and the agent working on it" />
</Frame>

### Review the changes

As the agent writes code, the [**Changes** panel](/workspaces/changes) updates with syntax-highlighted diffs — every file modified, every line added or removed.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspaces-changes-panel.png" alt="Changes panel showing syntax-highlighted diffs with a file tree" />
</Frame>

Hover over any line to reveal a comment icon. Click it, type what's wrong, and the agent reads your comment and adjusts its code. You can go back and forth as many times as you need — same workflow as [reviewing a colleague's pull request](/core-features/reviewing-code-changes), except the author responds in seconds.

<Frame caption="Inline comments on diffs — the agent reads these and updates its code">
  <img src="/images/workspaces-inline-comments.png" alt="Code diff with an inline review comment dialog" />
</Frame>

### Open a pull request

When the code looks right, click **Open pull request** in the Git panel.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspaces-create-pr.png" alt="Open pull request dialog showing branch and title" />
</Frame>

Your main branch was never touched. If you spot something after opening the PR, go back to the conversation and keep iterating — the PR updates automatically.

<Info>
Pull requests use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). If `gh` isn't installed, Vibe Kanban prompts you to set it up.

## Cloud — for teams

If you're working solo, workspaces are all you need. But teams need to know who's working on what, what's blocked, and what's ready for review. Cloud adds that layer.

### Sign in

Click **Login** in the sidebar. [Sign in](/cloud/authentication) with GitHub or Google. A personal organisation is created automatically.

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/cloud/sign-in-dialog.png" alt="Sign in dialog with GitHub and Google options" />
</Frame>

### Create a project

Click **+ New Project** in the sidebar. You get a [kanban board](/cloud/kanban-board) with **To do**, **In progress**, **In review**, and **Done** columns.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/project-kanban-board.png" alt="A kanban board with four status columns and issue cards" />
</Frame>

### Create issues

Click **+** on any column to [create an issue](/cloud/issues). Set a title, description, priority, and assignee. There's a toggle — **Create draft workspace immediately** — that creates the issue and launches a workspace for it at the same time. Your teammate sees the issue on the board, opens the workspace, picks an agent, and starts working.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/issue-overview.png" alt="Issue creation panel with title, description, priority, and a toggle to create a workspace immediately" />
</Frame>

### Invite your team

[Create a new organisation](/cloud/organizations) from the user menu and [invite members](/cloud/team-members) by email.

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/cloud/invite-member-dialog.png" alt="Invite team member dialog with email and role selection" />

## Safety

Agents run with full autonomous permissions (each agent's equivalent of `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or `--yolo`).

- **Worktree isolation** — each workspace is a separate git directory with its own branch. Agents cannot modify your main branch or other workspaces.
- **You review everything** — nothing gets merged until you click **Open pull request**.
- **Agents can run system commands** — they install packages, start dev servers, and run tests. They run with your user permissions.

<Warning>
Agents operate with the same system permissions as your user account. They can run arbitrary shell commands. Always review agent work before merging.
</Warning>
