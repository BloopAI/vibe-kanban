When you first run Vibe Kanban (`npx vibe-kanban`), you'll be guided through an onboarding process to configure the application for your workflow.

## What happens during onboarding

The onboarding process will ask you to:

- **Choose your default agent configuration**: Select your preferred coding agent and optional variant
- **Authenticate with GitHub**: Enable branch management and pull request tracking
- **Set up your workspace directory**: Define where your projects will be located
