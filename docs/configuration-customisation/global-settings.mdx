## Themes

Switch between light and dark themes to suit your preference.

## Default Agent Configuration

Choose the default agent and variant for new task attempts. This profile is pre-selected when creating new task attempts and follow-ups.

1. **Select an agent** (e.g., Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex)
2. **Choose a variant** if available (e.g., Default, Plan, Router)

<Tip>
You can override the default agent configuration per attempt in the create attempt dialog.
</Tip>

## Editor Integration

Configure integration with your preferred code editor for a seamless development workflow.

### Selecting Your Editor

Choose from various supported editors:
- **VS Code** - Microsoft's popular code editor
- **Cursor** - VSCode fork with AI-native features
- **Windsurf** - VSCode fork optimized for collaborative development
- **Neovim**, **Emacs**, **Sublime Text** - Other popular editors
- **Custom** - Use a custom shell command

### Remote SSH Configuration

When running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (e.g., accessed via Cloudflare tunnel, ngrok, or as a systemctl service), you can configure VSCode-based editors to open projects via SSH instead of assuming localhost.

This feature is available for **VS Code**, **Cursor**, and **Windsurf** editors.

#### When to Use Remote SSH

Enable remote SSH configuration when:
- Vibe Kanban runs on a remote server (VPS, cloud instance, etc.)
- You access the web UI through a tunnel or reverse proxy
- Your code files are on a different machine than your browser
- You want your local editor to connect to the remote server via SSH

#### Configuration Fields

1. **Remote SSH Host** (Optional)
   - The hostname or IP address of your remote server
   - Examples: `example.com`, `192.168.1.100`, `my-server`
   - Must be accessible via SSH from your local machine

2. **Remote SSH User** (Optional)
   - The SSH username for connecting to the remote server
   - If not specified, SSH will use your default user or SSH config

#### How It Works

When remote SSH is configured, clicking "Open in VSCode" (or Cursor/Windsurf):
1. Generates a special protocol URL like: `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path/to/project`
2. Opens in your default browser, which launches your local editor
3. Your editor connects to the remote server via SSH
4. The project or task worktree opens in the remote context

This works for both project-level and task worktree opening.

#### Prerequisites

- SSH access configured between your local machine and remote server
- SSH keys or credentials set up (no password prompts)
- VSCode Remote-SSH extension installed (or equivalent for Cursor/Windsurf)
- The remote server path must be accessible via SSH

<Tip>
Test your SSH connection first with `ssh user@host` to ensure it works without prompting for passwords.
</Tip>

## GitHub Integration

Link your GitHub account by providing a Personal Access Token (PAT) to enable:

- Automatic branch management
- Pull request creation and tracking
- Status synchronisation directly from Vibe Kanban

## Notifications

Toggle sound effects and push notifications to stay informed about task status changes.

## Telemetry

Enable or disable telemetry data collection to help improve Vibe Kanban.

## Task Templates

Manage global task templates to accelerate task creation across all projects. Templates allow you to define reusable titles and descriptions for common tasks.

## Agent Settings (Profiles & Variants)

Define and customise agent variants under **Settings → Agents**. Variants let you maintain multiple configurations for the same agent (for example, a Claude Code "PLAN" variant).

## Safety & Disclaimers

Manage acknowledgments and reset options for onboarding, safety disclaimers, and telemetry notices.

- **Onboarding**: Reset the onboarding process to rerun the initial setup.
- **Safety Disclaimer**: Reset or review the safety disclaimer prompt.
- **Telemetry Notice**: Reset or review the telemetry data collection acknowledgment.
