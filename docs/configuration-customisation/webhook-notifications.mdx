### Managing Multiple Webhooks

<Warning>
Make sure your webhook URLs are kept secure. Anyone with access to these URLs can send notifications to your channels.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

### Remote Server Deployments
When running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (VPS, cloud instance, etc.), webhook notifications ensure you're informed of upgrades even when you're not logged into the server.

### Team Notifications
Configure a webhook to a shared Slack or Discord channel to keep your entire team informed when Vibe Kanban is upgraded.

### Mobile Alerts
Use Pushover or Telegram to receive instant notifications on your mobile device, regardless of where you are.

### Integration with Custom Systems
Use the Generic webhook provider to integrate with your own notification systems, logging platforms, or automation workflows.

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Being Received

**Check the following:**
- Webhook is enabled (checkbox is checked)
- Upgrade notifications toggle is enabled
- Webhook URL is correct
- For Pushover: Both API token and user key are provided
- For Telegram: Both bot token URL and chat ID are provided

**Verify webhook endpoint:**
- Test your webhook URL independently using curl or Postman
- Check for any firewall rules blocking outbound HTTPS requests
- Review Vibe Kanban logs for error messages

### Provider-Specific Issues

**Slack:**
- Ensure the webhook URL starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/services/`
- Verify the webhook hasn't been revoked in Slack settings
- Check channel permissions

**Discord:**
- Confirm the webhook URL format: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`
- Verify the webhook hasn't been deleted in Discord server settings

**Pushover:**
- Validate your API token and user key
- Check your Pushover subscription status
- Ensure you've installed the Pushover mobile app

**Telegram:**
- Verify your bot token is correct
- Make sure you've started a conversation with your bot
- Confirm the chat ID is correct (positive for private chats, negative for groups)

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
Webhook URLs and API tokens are sensitive credentials that should be protected.
</Warning>

**Best Practices:**
- Store webhook URLs securely in the Vibe Kanban config file
- Don't commit webhook URLs to version control
- Rotate webhook URLs periodically
- Use HTTPS endpoints only
- Monitor webhook usage for unauthorized activity
- Consider using separate webhooks for different security contexts

## Future Enhancements

Potential future features for webhook notifications:
- Task completion notifications
- Error and failure alerts
- Custom notification templates
- Notification filtering and rules
- Webhook health monitoring
- More platform integrations (Microsoft Teams, Mattermost, etc.)
