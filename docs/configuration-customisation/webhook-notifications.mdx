Webhook notifications allow you to receive alerts when coding tasks complete through external services like Slack, Discord, Pushover, Telegram, or custom webhook endpoints. This is especially useful when running Vibe Kanban on remote servers where desktop notifications aren't accessible.

## Overview

### Managing Multiple Webhooks

You can configure multiple webhooks to receive notifications across different platforms:

</Tip>

## Use Cases

### Remote Server Deployments
When running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (VPS, cloud instance, etc.), webhook notifications ensure you're informed when tasks complete, even when you're not logged into the server.

### Team Notifications
Configure a webhook to a shared Slack or Discord channel to keep your entire team informed when tasks finish.

### Mobile Alerts
Use Pushover or Telegram to receive instant notifications on your mobile device when long-running tasks complete.

### Integration with Custom Systems
Use the Generic webhook provider to integrate with your own notification systems, logging platforms, or automation workflows.

## Notification Types

Vibe Kanban sends webhook notifications for the following task events:

### ‚úÖ Task Completed Successfully
Sent when a coding agent successfully completes a task.

### ‚ùå Task Failed
Sent when a task execution fails or encounters errors.

### üõë Task Cancelled
Sent when a task is manually stopped by the user.

<Note>
Webhook notifications are only sent when the **Enable Webhook Notifications** toggle is turned on in Settings.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Being Received

**Check the following:**
- Webhook notifications toggle is enabled
- Webhook is enabled (checkbox is checked)
- Webhook URL is correct
- For Pushover: Both API token and user key are provided
- For Telegram: Both bot token URL and chat ID are provided

**Verify webhook endpoint:**
- Test your webhook URL independently using curl or Postman
- Check for any firewall rules blocking outbound HTTPS requests
- Review Vibe Kanban logs for error messages

### Provider-Specific Issues

**Slack:**
- Ensure the webhook URL starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/services/`
- Verify the webhook hasn't been revoked in Slack settings
- Check channel permissions

**Discord:**
- Confirm the webhook URL format: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`
- Verify the webhook hasn't been deleted in Discord server settings

**Pushover:**
- Validate your API token and user key
- Check your Pushover subscription status
- Ensure you've installed the Pushover mobile app

**Telegram:**
- Verify your bot token is correct
- Make sure you've started a conversation with your bot
- Confirm the chat ID is correct (positive for private chats, negative for groups)

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
Webhook URLs and API tokens are sensitive credentials that should be protected.
</Warning>

**Best Practices:**
- Store webhook URLs securely in the Vibe Kanban config file
- Don't commit webhook URLs to version control
- Rotate webhook URLs periodically
- Use HTTPS endpoints only
- Monitor webhook usage for unauthorized activity
- Consider using separate webhooks for different security contexts

## Future Enhancements

Potential future features for webhook notifications:
- Custom notification templates
- Notification filtering by task status or executor
- Webhook health monitoring
- Retry logic for failed deliveries
- More platform integrations (Microsoft Teams, Mattermost, etc.)
