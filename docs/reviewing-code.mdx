After a coding agent finishes work, you review its changes, leave inline comments, and send the agent back to address them. This review-feedback-fix loop repeats until you are satisfied — then you create a pull request and merge.

## 1. Open the changes panel

There are three ways to open the changes panel:

- Click the **Changes** toggle (code-compare icon) in the navbar
- Click the changes icon in the floating context bar
- Use the [command bar](/workspaces/command-bar) (`Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Show Changes Panel")

<Frame>

</Frame>

The changes panel shows the diff viewer in the centre and the file tree on the right.

</Frame>

## 2. Navigate the file tree

The file tree shows all files that were added, modified, or deleted. Click any file to load its diff in the viewer.

</Frame>

Use the search box at the top to filter files by name. The toggle button in the search bar lets you expand or collapse all folders at once.

<Tip>
Start with the files you care most about — the main feature file or the entry point — rather than reviewing alphabetically. This gives you context for the rest of the changes.
</Tip>

## 3. Read diffs

The diff viewer uses colour coding to show what changed: green for additions, red for deletions, and grey for unchanged context lines.

You can switch between two view modes:

| Mode | Best for | How to switch |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Unified** | Quick scanning, small changes | Diff view toggle in the navbar |
| **Side-by-Side** | Large refactors, comparing old vs new | Same toggle, or `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Switch to Side-by-Side View" |

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/reviewing-code-side-by-side.png" alt="Side-by-side diff view showing additions in green and deletions in red" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/reviewing-code-unified.png" alt="Unified diff view showing interleaved additions and deletions" />
</Frame>

You can also switch views from the [command bar](/workspaces/command-bar) (`Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Switch to Side-by-Side View").

## 4. Add inline comments

To leave feedback on a specific line, hover over it in the diff and click the comment icon that appears. Write your comment and submit it.

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/reviewing-code-inline-comment.png" alt="Inline comment being written on a diff line with the Add Review Comment button" />
</Frame>

Good comments are specific and actionable. Here are some examples:

| Comment type | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Request a change** | "This endpoint should validate the user ID before querying the database." |
| **Ask a question** | "Why did you choose a Map here instead of a plain object?" |
| **Provide context** | "This function is called from the auth middleware — it needs to handle expired tokens." |

<Warning>
Comments are not sent individually. They are collected and submitted together when you send a message in the chat.
</Warning>

## 5. Send feedback to the agent

After adding all your comments, type a message in the chat (e.g. "Please address this review comments") and send. A badge shows how many review comments will be included. The agent sees all inline comments as context and works through them.

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/reviewing-code-agent-response.png" alt="Chat showing the agent responding to review comments and making changes" />
</Frame>

The issue moves back to **In Progress** while the agent addresses your feedback.

## 6. Iterate until satisfied

After the agent finishes addressing your comments, re-open the changes panel and review again. This is a loop: review, comment, send, wait, review.

Each iteration should have fewer comments. If the same issues keep recurring, consider adding a `CLAUDE.md` or coding conventions file to your repository so the agent learns your standards.

## 7. Create a pull request and merge

When the changes look good, create a pull request from the **Git** section in the right sidebar. Click **Open pull request** to open the PR dialog.

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "400px"}} src="/images/reviewing-code-create-pr.png" alt="Create pull request dialog with title, description, base branch, and draft toggle" />
</Frame>

Fill in the title, description, and base branch. Check **Create as draft** if you want feedback from your team before merging. You can also use **Auto-generate PR description with AI** to fill in the description automatically.

After the PR is created, CI runs and your team can review on GitHub. You can merge from GitHub or from the workspace's Git panel.

<Info>
If your workspace is linked to a GitHub PR, you can view GitHub review comments inline in the changes panel by clicking the GitHub icon. See [Changes Panel](/workspaces/changes) for details.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="The changes panel is empty">
- The agent may not have made any changes yet — check the workspace status
- If all changes were committed and pushed, the panel resets. Check the Git section for the latest commit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can't see my inline comments after sending">
Comments are consumed when you send a message. They become part of the chat history. Add new comments for the next review round.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The agent didn't address my comment">
Be more specific. Instead of "this is wrong", explain what is wrong and suggest a fix. Reference exact line numbers or variable names so the agent knows exactly where to look.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can't create a pull request">
- Check that GitHub integration is configured in **Settings** → **Integrations**
- Ensure the branch has committed changes and is pushed to the remote
- Verify you have write access to the repository
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GitHub comments aren't showing in the changes panel">
Click the GitHub icon in the changes panel toolbar to toggle them on. Only submitted reviews appear — pending GitHub reviews are not shown.
</Accordion>
