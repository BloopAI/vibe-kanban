After creating a project, add tasks by clicking the **Add Task** button in the navigation section of your project kanban page. Creating a task adds it to your kanban board without automatically starting a coding agent.

## Using Templates

</Frame>

When adding a task, you can select from your saved templates:

1. Click the **Use a template** dropdown
2. Choose from available global or project templates
3. The template automatically populates the task title and description

<Note>
Templates save time by reusing common task structures. Learn more about creating templates in the [Task Templates](/user-guide/creating-task-templates) guide.
</Note>

## Starting Task Attempts

</Frame>

To activate a coding agent on your task, create a task attempt:

<Steps>
<Step title="Select your agent profile">
  Choose from available agents (e.g., CLAUDE_CODE, GEMINI, CODEX). Your default configuration from Settings is pre-selected.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose a variant">
  If your selected agent has variants, pick the appropriate one (e.g., DEFAULT, PLAN).
</Step>

<Step title="Set the base branch">
  Specify which branch the agent should work from. Your current branch is selected by default.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use **Create & Start** to add the task and immediately create a task attempt with your default settings in one action.
</Tip>

Learn more about managing task attempts in the [Task Attempts](./creating-task-attempts) guide.

## Understanding Task Columns

Tasks begin in the "To do" column and move automatically based on their progress:

| Action | Column |
|--------|---------|
| Task created | To do |
| Task attempt started | In Progress |
| Task attempt completed (success or failure) | In Review |
| Task attempt merged | Done |
| PR merged on GitHub | Done |

<Info>
You can manually drag tasks between columns, but this won't trigger any functionality. Task movement is primarily driven by coding agent actions and GitHub integration (which polls every 60 seconds).
