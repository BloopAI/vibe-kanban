A task attempt represents a single execution of a coding agent against a task. Any follow-up questions within the same session attach to the same task attempt.

## Setup Script Execution

</Frame>

When you start a task attempt, any setup script defined in your project settings runs automatically before agent execution begins.

<Note>
Setup scripts help prepare your environment with dependencies, configuration, or initialization steps before the agent starts working.
</Note>

## Agent Execution

After setup scripts complete, the coding agent executes using your task title and description. You can monitor progress through real-time log streaming in the interface.

### Selecting Profiles and Variants

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose an agent profile">
  Select your desired agent from the available profiles configured in your project.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a variant (if available)">
  Choose a specific variant for specialized behavior, such as planning-focused or debugging-focused configurations.
</Step>

<Step title="Manage configurations">
  Configure profiles and variants under **Settings â†’ Agents**. See [Agent Profiles & Variants](/user-guide/agent-configurations) for detailed configuration options.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Follow-Up Questions

After agent execution completes, you can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions in the input box at the bottom of the task attempt dialog.

<Tip>
Follow-up questions help refine results or request additional changes without starting a new task attempt.
</Tip>

## Task Attempt Toolbar Actions

</Frame>

Use the toolbar to access these key actions:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Dev Server">
  Starts a development server for your project. This terminates any existing dev servers running for the same project.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="History">
  View all previous attempts for this task, including their status and outcomes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rebase">
  Updates your task branch with changes from the base branch. Only appears when your branch is behind. Rebase fails if conflicts exist.

  <Warning>
  Resolve any merge conflicts manually before attempting to rebase.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create PR">
  Opens a dialog to create a pull request in GitHub directly from your task attempt.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Merge">
  Merges the task branch into its base branch once you're satisfied with the results.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="New Attempt">
  Starts a fresh task attempt, useful for trying different approaches or agent configurations.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Git Worktrees

Vibe Kanban uses Git worktrees to create isolated environments for each task attempt. These environments are ephemeral and automatically cleaned up after execution completes.

<Info>
Worktrees ensure task attempts don't interfere with each other or your main working directory.
