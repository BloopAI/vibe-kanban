Workspaces include a built-in preview browser and a redesigned changes panel for reviewing code modifications.

## Preview Browser

Test your application without leaving the workspace.

### Opening the Preview

- Click the **Preview** toggle in the navbar
- Use the [command bar](/workspaces/command-bar): `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Toggle Preview Panel"
- Click the preview icon in the context bar

The preview panel automatically opens when a dev server starts.

### Starting the Dev Server

1. Click **Toggle Dev Server** in the context bar
2. Or use the command bar: "Toggle Dev Server"
3. The preview panel opens automatically
4. Your application loads in the built-in browser

### Device Modes

Test across different viewport sizes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Desktop** | Full-width browser view |
| **Mobile** | Mobile device dimensions |
| **Custom** | Set specific viewport width and height |

Switch modes using the device selector in the preview toolbar.

### Multiple Dev Servers

For projects with multiple services:

- Each dev server appears as a tab
- Switch between servers to view different parts of your application
- Logs are separated per server

### Viewing Logs

The preview panel includes a log viewer:

- View stdout/stderr from your dev server
- **View Full Logs** button for complete output
- Logs update in real-time
- Filter or search log content

<Tip>
If your preview isn't loading, check the logs for error messages or port conflicts.

## Changes Panel

| **Additions** | Green highlighting for new lines |
| **Deletions** | Red highlighting for removed lines |
| **Context** | Surrounding unchanged lines for reference |
| **Line numbers** | Original and new line numbers |

### Diff View Modes

Toggle between two display modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Unified** | Inline view with changes interleaved |
| **Side-by-Side** | Original and modified shown in parallel columns |

Switch modes via the navbar button or command bar: "Toggle Diff View Mode"

### Diff Options

Customise the diff display:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wrap Lines** | Enable/disable line wrapping for long lines |
| **Ignore Whitespace** | Show/hide whitespace-only changes |

Add comments directly on code changes to provide feedback to agents.

### Adding Comments

1. Hover over a line in the diff
2. Click the comment icon that appears
3. Write your feedback
4. Submit the comment

### Comment Uses

- **Request changes**: Ask the agent to modify specific code
- **Ask questions**: Get explanations about implementation choices
- **Provide context**: Share additional requirements or constraints
- **Approve sections**: Indicate code that looks good

<Info>
Comments are visible to the agent in subsequent messages, helping guide further development.
</Info>

## GitHub Integration

When your workspace is linked to a pull request:

### Viewing GitHub Comments

- Toggle **Show GitHub Comments** in the changes panel
- Comments from the PR appear inline with the diff
- Badge shows comment count per file

### Navigating Comments

- Use **Previous/Next** buttons to jump between files with comments
- Comments are highlighted in the diff view
- Reply to comments directly from the workspace

### Linking to a PR

Workspaces automatically link when:

- You create a PR from the workspace
- The workspace branch matches an existing PR

<Tip>
Review GitHub comments alongside your changes to address PR feedback efficiently.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Preview Workflow

1. Start the dev server early in your task
2. Keep the preview visible while the agent works
3. Test changes incrementally
4. Use device modes to verify responsive design

### Code Review Workflow

1. Open the changes panel after the agent completes work
2. Review diffs file by file
3. Add comments for any needed changes
4. Let the agent address feedback
5. Re-review and approve
