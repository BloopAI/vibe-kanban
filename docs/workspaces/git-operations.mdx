Workspaces provide integrated git operations for managing your code changes.

## Repository Status

The Git section in the right sidebar shows:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Repository name** | Current repository with status |
| **Current branch** | Your working branch |
| **Target branch** | Branch you'll merge into |
| **Uncommitted changes** | Number of modified files |
| **Ahead/Behind** | Commits relative to target branch |
| **Conflict indicator** | Shows when merge conflicts exist |

## Creating Pull Requests

</Frame>

Create PRs directly from your workspace.

### Creating a PR

1. Open the [command bar](/workspaces/command-bar): `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
2. Select **Create Pull Request**
3. Fill in the PR details:
   - **Auto-generate PR description with AI** - Let AI write the description based on your changes
   - **Title** - PR title (auto-filled from task name)
   - **Description** - Optional details about the changes
   - **Base Branch** - The branch to merge into
   - **Create as draft** - Mark as draft PR
4. Click **Create PR**

### Draft PRs

Enable **Draft** mode when:

- Work is still in progress
- You want early feedback before completion
- CI checks should run but reviewers shouldn't merge yet

### Multi-Repo PRs

For workspaces with multiple repositories:

- Create PRs for each repo separately
- Use the Repo Actions in the command bar
- Reference related PRs in descriptions

<Tip>
Create PRs early to get CI feedback and enable team visibility into your progress.
</Tip>

## Merging Changes

Merge your branch into the target branch.

### Merge Process

1. Open the command bar: `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
2. Select **Merge**
3. Confirm the merge operation
4. Changes are merged into the target branch

### Before Merging

The workspace checks if you're behind the target branch:

- **Up to date**: Merge proceeds normally
- **Behind target**: You'll be prompted to rebase first

<Warning>
Always ensure CI checks pass and code reviews are complete before merging.
</Warning>

## Rebasing

Keep your branch up to date with the target branch.

### Rebase Process

1. Open the command bar: `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
2. Select **Rebase**
3. Confirm the rebase operation
4. Your commits are replayed on top of the target branch

### Handling Conflicts

<Frame>

</Frame>

If conflicts occur during rebase:

1. The workspace shows a conflict resolution dialog
2. List of conflicting files is displayed
3. Resolve conflicts in your editor
4. Mark files as resolved
5. Continue or abort the rebase

### When to Rebase

- Before creating a pull request
- When the target branch has new commits
- Before merging to ensure a clean history
- When prompted due to being behind target

## Changing Target Branch

Switch the branch you're merging into.

### Changing the Target

1. Open the command bar: `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
2. Select **Change Target Branch**
3. Choose the new target branch
4. Workspace updates to show new ahead/behind status

### Use Cases

- Switch from `develop` to `main` for release
- Target a feature branch instead of main
- Correct an incorrectly set target

## Pushing Changes

Push your commits to the remote repository.

### When Push is Available

The Push command appears when:

- You have unpushed commits
- A pull request is open for the branch

### Pushing

1. Open the command bar: `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
2. Select **Push**
3. Commits are pushed to the remote

<Info>
Push is contextual - it only appears when there are changes to push and a PR exists.
</Info>

## Multi-Repository Git Operations

For workspaces with multiple repositories, manage each repo independently.

### Per-Repository Actions

Access via command bar's **Repo Actions** page:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Create PR | Create PR for specific repository |
| Merge | Merge specific repository only |
| Rebase | Rebase specific repository |
| Change Target | Change target for specific repo |

### Coordinating Changes

When working across repos:

1. Make related changes in each repository
2. Create linked PRs referencing each other
3. Merge in the correct order based on dependencies
4. Verify integration after merging

## Conflict Resolution

When git conflicts occur:

### Conflict Dialog

The workspace displays a conflict resolution dialog showing:

- List of conflicting files
- Options to resolve or abort

### Resolution Steps

1. Open conflicting files in your editor
2. Resolve the conflicts manually
3. Save the resolved files
4. Return to the workspace
5. Continue the operation

### Aborting

If you can't resolve conflicts:

- Click **Abort** in the conflict dialog
- The operation is cancelled
- Your branch returns to its previous state

<Warning>
Unresolved conflicts block git operations. Always resolve or abort before continuing work.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Branch Hygiene

- Rebase regularly to stay current with target
- Create PRs early for visibility
- Use descriptive branch names
- Delete merged branches

### PR Workflow

1. Complete your changes
2. Review diffs in the changes panel
3. Rebase if behind target
4. Create a PR (draft if work continues)
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge when approved

### Multi-Repo Coordination

- Plan cross-repo changes upfront
- Document dependencies between PRs
- Merge in dependency order
- Test integration thoroughly
