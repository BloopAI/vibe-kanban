Self-hosting Vibe Kanban Cloud gives you complete control over your data while providing the same real-time collaboration features as the hosted version.

## Why Self-Host?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Data Privacy" icon="shield-halved">
  Keep all your project data on your own infrastructure. No data leaves your servers.
</Card>

<Card title="Full Control" icon="sliders">
  Customise the deployment to your needs. No usage limits or restrictions.
</Card>

<Card title="Compliance" icon="clipboard-check">
  Meet internal security and compliance requirements by hosting within your own environment.
</Card>

<Card title="Cost Control" icon="coins">
  For larger teams, self-hosting can be more cost-effective than per-seat pricing.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Billing

The self-hosted build does **not** include any billing or payment functionality. The billing crate is a private dependency that is automatically stripped during the Docker build process. All features work without restrictions — there are no seat limits, usage caps, or feature gates.

## Architecture Overview

The self-hosted Vibe Kanban Cloud stack consists of three main components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Database for storing projects, issues, and user data |
| **ElectricSQL** | Real-time sync engine that powers instant updates across all clients |
| **Remote Server** | API server and web frontend for Vibe Kanban Cloud |

The Remote Server connects to PostgreSQL for data storage and to ElectricSQL for real-time synchronisation. The Vibe Kanban desktop client connects to the Remote Server.

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** v2.0+
- **2GB RAM** minimum (4GB recommended)
- **10GB disk space** for database and application data

### OAuth Provider

You need at least one OAuth provider configured for user authentication:

- **GitHub OAuth App** - [Create one here](https://github.com/settings/developers)
- **Google OAuth App** - [Create one here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

## Quick Start

For a quick local setup, see [Local Development](/self-hosting/local-development).

For production deployments, see our platform-specific guides:

- [Deploy with Cloudflare Tunnel](/self-hosting/deploy-cloudflare) - Secure exposure without open ports
- [Deploy to Fly.io](/self-hosting/deploy-flyio) - Global edge deployment
- [Deploy to Railway](/self-hosting/deploy-railway) - One-click deployment
- [Deploy with Docker Compose](/self-hosting/deploy-docker) - Any Linux server

## Environment Variables

All deployments require these environment variables:

### Required

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VIBEKANBAN_REMOTE_JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing JWT tokens. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 48` |
| `ELECTRIC_ROLE_PASSWORD` | Password for the `electric_sync` database role used by ElectricSQL |

<Info>
The `electric_sync` database user is created automatically by the Remote Server on first startup. This means you must deploy and start the Remote Server before ElectricSQL can connect to the database.
</Info>

### OAuth (at least one required)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth app client ID |
| `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth app client secret |
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth app client ID |
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth app client secret |

<Info>
You need to configure at least one OAuth provider (GitHub or Google). You can configure both for user choice.
</Info>

### Server URLs

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SERVER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | **Required.** Public URL of your deployment (e.g., `https://vk.example.com`). The server will fail to start without this. |
| `VITE_APP_BASE_URL` | Public URL used by the frontend (typically same as `SERVER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`) |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | API URL used by the frontend (typically same as `SERVER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`) |

### Optional

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `LOOPS_EMAIL_API_KEY` | API key for sending invitation emails. Leave empty to disable. |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Cloudflare R2 access key for code review storage |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | GitHub App ID for deeper GitHub integration |

## Connecting Your Client

Once your self-hosted server is running, configure the Vibe Kanban desktop client to connect to it:

```bash
export VK_SHARED_API_BASE=https://your-server.example.com
```

Or set it in your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) for persistence.
