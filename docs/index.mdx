If you've used Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini to write code, you know the problem: the agent rewrites half your files, you're not sure what changed, and your working branch is a mess. Rolling back means cherry-picking through diffs. Running multiple agents on different tasks means juggling terminal sessions and hoping they don't step on each other.

Vibe Kanban gives every task its own git worktree — a dedicated branch and directory that's completely isolated from your main branch and from every other task. You describe what you want, the agent builds it, and you review the result as a clean diff. If you like it, open a PR. If you don't, delete the worktree. Your repo was never touched.

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

One command, opens in your browser, no account needed.

## Workspaces

A [workspace](/workspaces/index) is the core unit. You get a four-panel layout: conversation with the agent on the left, code diffs on the right, plus a [git panel](/workspaces/git-operations), terminal, and [live preview](/workspaces/preview).

</Frame>

The part that matters most is the [changes panel](/workspaces/changes). You see every file the agent modified, every line added or removed. Hover over a line and a comment icon appears — click it and write what's wrong. The agent reads your comment and adjusts the code. This back-and-forth is what turns "AI-generated code" into code you actually trust.

When you're satisfied, click **Open pull request** and the workspace branch becomes a PR. You can also run [multiple agents in parallel sessions](/workspaces/sessions) on the same task — useful when you want to compare how Claude Code and Codex approach the same problem.

## Cloud

Workspaces work great for solo developers. But if you're on a team and need to coordinate who's working on what, you need more structure.

Cloud adds a shared [kanban board](/cloud/kanban-board). You create [issues](/cloud/issues) with titles, descriptions, priorities, and assignees, then drag them across **To do**, **In progress**, **In review**, and **Done** columns. Standard stuff — but the difference is every issue can have a workspace attached to it.

</Frame>

When you create an issue, there's a toggle: **Create draft workspace immediately**. Turn it on, and Vibe Kanban creates the issue and opens a workspace for it at the same time. Your teammate sees the issue on the board, opens the workspace, picks an agent, and starts working. The kanban card updates as the workspace progresses. [Learn more about Cloud →](/cloud/index)
