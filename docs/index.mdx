Vibe Kanban is an open-source orchestration layer for AI coding agents. You describe a task in plain English, an agent writes the code, and you review it — all from one interface that keeps your main branch safe.

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

That's it. Opens in your browser, no account required.

## Two ways to work

Vibe Kanban gives you two complementary interfaces: **Workspaces** for hands-on coding with agents, and **Cloud** for team-level project management.

### Workspaces — your AI coding environment

Each workspace is an isolated environment for one task. You get your own git branch, a conversation with an agent, a diff viewer, and a live preview — all in a single screen.

</Frame>

You describe what you want. The agent writes the code. You review every line, hover to leave inline comments, and iterate until it's right. Then open a pull request — your main branch was never touched.

### Cloud — kanban board for your team

Cloud adds a shared kanban board, issues with IDs, priorities, assignees, and real-time sync. Your team sees the same board, and anyone can spin up a workspace to start working on an issue.

Create issues, assign them, drag them across columns, and link workspaces to track progress — all synced in real-time across your team.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Describe what you want">
  Open a workspace, pick a coding agent, and type what you need — "add a dark mode toggle" or "fix the login redirect bug". The agent starts working immediately.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the changes">
  Every change happens in an isolated git worktree. You see line-by-line diffs, hover to leave inline comments, and send feedback back to the agent — just like a code review.
</Step>

<Step title="Ship it">
  When you're happy, click **Open pull request** in the workspace. Your main branch was never touched.
</Step>
</Steps>
