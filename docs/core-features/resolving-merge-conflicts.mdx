## When You See "Rebase Needed"

When your task's base branch advances while you're working, you'll see a **Rebase** button indicating your branch needs to be updated.

</Frame>

Click the **Rebase** button to update your branch with the latest changes from the base branch.

## What Happens When You Rebase

After clicking rebase, one of two things occurs:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Clean Rebase">
  If there are no conflicts, the rebase completes automatically and your task becomes ready to merge.
  
  <Check>
  Your task status updates and the **Merge** button becomes available.
  </Check>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Rebase Conflicts">
  If your changes conflict with the base branch, the status changes to "Rebase conflicts" and a conflict resolution banner appears.
  
  <Warning>
  The rebase process pauses until conflicts are resolved.
  </Warning>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Resolving Conflicts Automatically

When conflicts occur, the simplest solution is to let the coding agent resolve them automatically.

</Frame>

The conflict banner provides three options:
- **Open in Editor** - Manually edit conflicted files
- **Insert Resolve-Conflicts Instructions** - Auto-generate resolution instructions
- **Abort Rebase** - Cancel and return to previous state

### Recommended Approach: Automatic Resolution

<Steps>
<Step title="Insert conflict resolution instructions">
  Click **Insert Resolve-Conflicts Instructions** from the conflict banner.
  
  This generates specific instructions tailored to your conflict situation and inserts them into the follow-up message area.
</Step>

<Step title="Send to coding agent">
  Review the generated instructions and click **Send**.
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for resolution">
  The agent will:
  1. Analyze the conflicted files
  2. Make intelligent resolution decisions
  3. Stage the resolved files
  4. Continue the rebase process automatically
</Step>
</Steps>

Once the agent completes the resolution, your task status returns to **Ready to Merge**.

## Manual Resolution (Alternative)

If you prefer to resolve conflicts manually:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open in editor">
  Click **Open in Editor** from the conflict banner to access the worktree files.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit conflicted files">
  Resolve merge markers in each file:
  
  ```diff
  <<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
  function newFeature() {
    return "new implementation";
  }
  =======
  function oldFeature() {
    return "existing implementation";
  }
  >>>>>>> main (base branch changes)
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Continue the rebase">
  After editing, stage and continue:
  
  ```bash
  git add resolved-file.js
  git rebase --continue
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Aborting a Rebase

If you need to cancel the rebase entirely, click **Abort Rebase** to return to the "Rebase needed" state. You can then try rebasing again or create a new task attempt from the updated base branch.

<Tip>
Automatic resolution works best for most conflicts. Use manual resolution only when you need precise control over the merge decisions.
