## Local Projects Overview

The local project kanban board is the original Vibe Kanban interface. It is still accessible at `/local-projects` in the application but is **no longer the recommended workflow**.

<Warning>
Local projects are a legacy feature. New users should start with [Workspaces](/workspaces/index) for the best experience.
</Warning>

## What Are Local Projects?

Local projects provide a kanban-style board for managing coding tasks on a single machine. Tasks run in isolated git worktrees and are tracked entirely on your local file system.

## Recommended Workflow

Vibe Kanban now centres on **Workspaces** and **Cloud**:

- **Workspaces** give you a richer development environment with multi-repo support, sessions, a built-in preview browser, and a command bar.
- **Cloud** enables team collaboration with synced issues, organisations, and a shared kanban board.

## Accessing Local Projects

If you have existing local projects, you can still access them by navigating to `/local-projects` in your browser whilst Vibe Kanban is running.

<Note>
Existing local project data is preserved. You can continue using local projects alongside Workspaces if needed.
