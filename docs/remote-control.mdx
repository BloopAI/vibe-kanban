Remote Access allows you to access a local running instance of Vibe Kanban
from anywhere.

For example, you can run Vibe Kanban on your laptop, then keep prompting from
your phone. The execution continues to take place on your laptop, but you are
controlling your local instance of Vibe Kanban from your phone.
