# Image Support Implementation - Completed ✅

## Summary
The image input support for Vibe Kanban has been successfully implemented and all builds are passing.

## What Was Done

### Backend Implementation:
1. ✅ Created database migration for `task_attachments` table
2. ✅ Implemented `TaskAttachment` model with SQLx queries
3. ✅ Updated task creation API to accept base64-encoded images
4. ✅ Modified Claude executor to save images as temp files and include paths in prompts
5. ✅ Added base64 dependency for decoding image data
6. ✅ Successfully ran migrations and updated SQLx cache

### Frontend Implementation:
1. ✅ Created reusable `ImageUpload` component with:
   - Drag and drop support
   - File browser support
   - Paste image support (Ctrl+V)
   - Image preview
   - Remove functionality
2. ✅ Integrated image upload into `TaskFormDialog`
3. ✅ Updated task creation flow to send attachments
4. ✅ Added proper TypeScript types

### Build Status:
- ✅ Backend builds successfully
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ SQLx queries are properly cached
- ✅ All TypeScript types are correct

## How to Use

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Create a task with images:**
   - Click "New Task" in a project
   - Add images using:
     - Drag & drop files onto the upload area
     - Click "Choose Images" to browse
     - Take a screenshot and paste with Ctrl+V
   - Fill in task title and description
   - Click "Create & Start"

3. **What happens:**
   - Images are encoded as base64 and sent to the backend
   - Backend stores images in the SQLite database
   - When executing, images are saved to temp files
   - File paths are included in the prompt sent to Claude Code

## Technical Details

- **Max file size:** 10MB per image
- **Max images per task:** 5
- **Supported formats:** All image/* MIME types
- **Storage:** SQLite BLOB in `task_attachments` table
- **Temp files:** Created in system temp directory during execution

## Example Prompt Format

When Claude Code receives a task with images, the prompt looks like:
```
project_id: <uuid>

Attached images:
- /tmp/vibe_attachment_<uuid>_screenshot.png
- /tmp/vibe_attachment_<uuid>_mockup.jpg

Task title: Implement the UI shown in the screenshots
Task description: Please implement the components shown in the attached images...
```

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Image compression before storage
- External storage (S3, CDN) for large files
- Virus scanning for uploaded files
- Display attachments in task details view
- Support for non-image file types
