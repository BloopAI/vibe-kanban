## Entries

- 2026-02-22 14:42 UTC - Pre-parallel stabilization pass:
  moved `components/ui-new/dialogs/KanbanFiltersDialog.tsx` to canonical
  `features/kanban/ui/dialogs/KanbanFiltersDialog.tsx`; moved settings RJSF
  modules (`Fields.tsx`, `Templates.tsx`, `Widgets.tsx`, `theme.ts`) to
  `features/settings/ui/dialogs/settings/rjsf/**`; added strict legacy
  re-export facades at original `components/ui-new/dialogs/**` paths; repointed
  callsites in `features/kanban/ui/KanbanContainer.tsx` and
  `features/settings/ui/dialogs/settings/ExecutorConfigForm.tsx`; resolved
  feature-layer lint boundary in kanban dialog by importing
  `@/components/ui-new/dialogs/AssigneeSelectionDialog` compatibility
  entrypoint. Checks: `pnpm run format`, `pnpm run web:check`,
  `pnpm run web:lint` all passed.
- 2026-02-22 15:53 UTC - Executed `packages-web-dialogs-root-migration-plan.md`:
  moved dialog implementations from `features/*/ui/dialogs/**` and
  `shared/ui/dialogs/**` into `src/dialogs/**` (including command-bar helpers,
  settings sections, and RJSF modules); recreated legacy files under
  `features/*/ui/dialogs/**`, `shared/ui/dialogs/**`, `components/dialogs/**`,
  and `components/ui-new/dialogs/**` as strict re-export facades targeting
  `@/dialogs/**`; added canonical `src/dialogs/index.ts`; bulk-rewrote dialog
  imports via `scripts/dialog-import-rewrite-map.tsv`; confirmed no remaining
  imports from legacy dialog roots in `packages/web/src`. Checks:
  `pnpm run format`, `pnpm run web:check`, `pnpm run web:lint`, and
  `scripts/check-legacy-frontend-paths.sh` all passed.
