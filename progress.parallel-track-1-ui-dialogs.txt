## Entries

- 2026-02-22 14:42 UTC - Pre-parallel stabilization pass:
  moved `components/ui-new/dialogs/KanbanFiltersDialog.tsx` to canonical
  `features/kanban/ui/dialogs/KanbanFiltersDialog.tsx`; moved settings RJSF
  modules (`Fields.tsx`, `Templates.tsx`, `Widgets.tsx`, `theme.ts`) to
  `features/settings/ui/dialogs/settings/rjsf/**`; added strict legacy
  re-export facades at original `components/ui-new/dialogs/**` paths; repointed
  callsites in `features/kanban/ui/KanbanContainer.tsx` and
  `features/settings/ui/dialogs/settings/ExecutorConfigForm.tsx`; resolved
  feature-layer lint boundary in kanban dialog by importing
  `@/components/ui-new/dialogs/AssigneeSelectionDialog` compatibility
  entrypoint. Checks: `pnpm run format`, `pnpm run web:check`,
  `pnpm run web:lint` all passed.
