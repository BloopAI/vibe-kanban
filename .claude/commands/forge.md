## üöÄ FORGE EXECUTION WORKFLOW

When a user invokes `/forge`, you orchestrate the transformation of a wish specification into actionable Forge tasks through the specialized forge-master agent.

### Phase 1: Wish Validation

<context_gathering>
Goal: Verify wish is ready for execution

Method:
- Check wish file exists and is complete
- Validate wish status is APPROVED
- Ensure all task groups are defined
- Confirm success criteria are measurable

Early stop criteria:
- Wish file found and readable
- Status confirmed as APPROVED
- Task decomposition complete
</context_gathering>

**1.1 Pre-Flight Checklist**
```
[VALIDATION]
‚úÖ Wish file exists at specified path
‚úÖ Wish status = APPROVED
‚úÖ Task groups A-E defined
‚úÖ Dependencies mapped
‚úÖ Success criteria measurable
```

**1.2 Extract Task Groups**
Parse the wish for:
- Group dependencies
- Parallel execution opportunities  
- File creation/modification paths
- Success validation steps

### Phase 2: Forge Task Generation

**2.1 Trigger forge-master Agent**

<task_breakdown>
1. [Preparation] Ready the wish for agent consumption
   - Format wish path with @ prefix for auto-loading
   - Identify task complexity levels
   - Map to reasoning_effort settings

2. [Invocation] Call forge-master with structured prompt
   - Pass wish specification
   - Include project context
   - Set appropriate complexity flags

3. [Verification] Confirm task creation
   - Validate all groups processed
   - Check task IDs generated
   - Verify branch names created
</task_breakdown>

**2.2 Agent Invocation Template**

```markdown
/agent forge-master

## Mission
Transform the approved wish into Forge tasks with Advanced Prompting Framework optimization.

## Context
@{wish-file-path}
@.claude/commands/prompt.md [framework reference]

## Project Configuration
- Project ID: 9ac59f5a-2d01-4800-83cd-491f638d2f38
- Repository: automagik-forge

## Task Creation Instructions

<persistence>
- Create all task groups from the wish
- Never skip dependencies or success criteria
- Document every framework pattern applied
- Complete all tasks before yielding
</persistence>

### Group Processing Order

For each task group in the wish (A through E):

1. **Analyze Complexity**
   - Simple fix: minimal/think
   - Feature: medium/think hard  
   - Architecture: high/think harder
   - Multi-step: max/ultrathink

2. **Apply Framework Patterns**

For Group A (Foundation):
<context_gathering>
- Search depth: low (files are specified)
- Parallelize all A tasks
- reasoning_effort: {appropriate level}
</context_gathering>

For Group B-C (Core/UI):
<task_breakdown>
1. [Discovery] Components from A
2. [Implementation] Create services/components
3. [Verification] Test endpoints/rendering
</task_breakdown>

For Group D (Integration):
<persistence>
- Ensure all B & C outputs available
- Never proceed without dependencies
- Document integration points
</persistence>

For Group E (Testing):
<self_reflection>
Rubric: Functionality, Performance, Security
Iterate until all criteria met
</self_reflection>

3. **Generate Forge Tasks**

Create tasks with:
- Title format: {type}: {clear description}
- Branch: {type}/{kebab-feature}-{group}{number}
- Description: Include all @ references from wish

## Success Validation

<success_criteria>
‚úÖ All task groups have Forge task IDs
‚úÖ Dependencies properly linked
‚úÖ Branch names follow conventions
‚úÖ Framework patterns embedded
‚úÖ Success metrics defined
</success_criteria>

Report created tasks:
- Group A: [task IDs and branches]
- Group B: [task IDs and branches]
- Group C: [task IDs and branches]
- Group D: [task IDs and branches]
- Group E: [task IDs and branches]
```

### Phase 3: Execution Orchestration

**3.1 Task Execution Strategy**

```mermaid
graph LR
    W[Wish] --> FM[forge-master]
    FM --> A1[Task A1]
    FM --> A2[Task A2]
    FM --> A3[Task A3]
    A1 & A2 & A3 --> B[Group B Tasks]
    A1 & A2 & A3 --> C[Group C Tasks]
    B & C --> D[Group D Tasks]
    D --> E[Group E Tasks]
```

**3.2 Parallel Execution Rules**
- Groups with no dependencies execute simultaneously
- Within groups, tasks marked parallel run concurrently
- Integration points require synchronization
- Testing waits for all implementation

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking

<tool_preambles>
- Report each task creation with ID and branch
- Update on group completion
- Flag any creation failures immediately
- Summarize final task tree structure
</tool_preambles>

**4.1 Status Reporting Format**
```
üìã Forge Execution Status

Wish: {feature-name}
Tasks Created: {N} tasks in {M} groups

Group A (Foundation): ‚úÖ 3 tasks created
- A1-types: task-id-xxx (branch: feat/omni-types-a1)
- A2-config: task-id-yyy (branch: feat/omni-config-a2)
- A3-frontend: task-id-zzz (branch: feat/omni-frontend-a3)

[Continue for all groups...]

Execution Ready: All tasks queued for agent processing
```

## üé® Framework Pattern Application

### Complexity Mapping
| Wish Complexity | Reasoning Effort | Context Gathering | Persistence |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Simple fix | minimal/think | very low, 2 tools | not needed |
| Feature add | medium/think hard | moderate, targeted | on integration |
| Refactor | high/think harder | thorough, systematic | throughout |
| Architecture | max/ultrathink | comprehensive | every step |

### Pattern Injection Examples

**For Simple Tasks:**
```xml
<context_gathering>
- Search depth: very low
- Max 2 tool calls
- Bias for quick response
- reasoning_effort: minimal/think
</context_gathering>
```

**For Complex Features:**
```xml
<persistence>
- Continue until all subtasks complete
- Document every decision
- Never stop at uncertainty
- reasoning_effort: high/think harder
</persistence>
<self_reflection>
Internal rubric for quality checks
Iterate until standards met
</self_reflection>
```

**For UI Components:**
```xml
<code_editing_rules>
<frontend_stack_defaults>
- Framework: React + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Components: shadcn/ui
- Icons: Lucide
</frontend_stack_defaults>
</code_editing_rules>
```

## üîß Command Usage

### Basic Invocation
```bash
/forge /genie/wishes/{feature-name}-wish.md
```

### With Options
```bash
/forge /genie/wishes/{feature-name}-wish.md --complexity=high --parallel=true
```

### Batch Execution
```bash
/forge /genie/wishes/*.md --approved-only
```

## üìä Success Metrics

<success_criteria>
‚úÖ Wish successfully parsed and validated
‚úÖ forge-master agent invoked with proper context
‚úÖ All task groups converted to Forge tasks
‚úÖ Task IDs and branches reported
‚úÖ Dependencies properly mapped
‚úÖ Framework patterns applied appropriately
‚úÖ Execution can proceed without manual intervention
</success_criteria>

## ‚ùå Failure Handling

<never_do>
‚ùå Execute unapproved wishes
‚ùå Skip dependency validation
‚ùå Create tasks without framework patterns
‚ùå Ignore success criteria
‚ùå Proceed with incomplete task groups
</never_do>

## üéØ Integration with Wish Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    U[User Request] -->|/wish| W[Wish Creation]
    W -->|Iterate| R[Refinement]
    R -->|Approve| A[APPROVED Status]
    A -->|/forge| F[Forge Execution]
    F -->|forge-master| T[Task Creation]
    T -->|Agents| E[Execution]
    E -->|Complete| S[Success]
```

## üí° Key Principles

1. **Wish Validation First**: Never execute incomplete wishes
2. **Framework Optimization**: Every task gets appropriate patterns
3. **Dependency Respect**: Groups execute in proper order
4. **Parallel Maximization**: Run everything possible simultaneously
5. **Clear Reporting**: User knows exactly what was created
6. **Agent Autonomy**: Tasks are self-contained for agent execution

**Remember:** The `/forge` command is the bridge between wish specification and actual implementation. It transforms human-readable wishes into agent-optimized Forge tasks using the Advanced Prompting Framework for maximum execution efficiency.
