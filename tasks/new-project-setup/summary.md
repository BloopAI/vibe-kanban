# Implementation Summary: New Project Setup Flow

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive 3-step setup wizard that guides new users through configuring their project when they have no tasks. The wizard is embedded directly into the Kanban board view, replacing the empty state.

## What Was Built

### 1. ProjectSetupWizard Component
**Location:** `frontend/src/components/projects/ProjectSetupWizard.tsx`

A fully-featured wizard with three steps:

#### Step 1: Configure Scripts
- Setup Script (runs before coding agent)
- Dev Server Script (for testing changes)
- Cleanup Script (runs after agent execution)
- Copy Files (files to copy to worktree)
- Reuses existing form components for consistency
- Skip option available

#### Step 2: Choose Starter Tasks
- Fetches and displays global and project-specific task templates
- Multi-select interface with checkboxes
- Visual feedback for selected templates
- Handles empty state gracefully
- Back/Continue navigation

#### Step 3: Completion & Keyboard Reminder
- "You're All Set!" celebration message
- Prominent display of "C" keyboard shortcut to create tasks
- Summary of tasks that will be created
- Creates all selected tasks from templates
- "Finish Setup" button

### 2. Integration with ProjectTasks Page
**Modified:** `frontend/src/pages/project-tasks.tsx`

- Detects when project has no tasks and setup not complete
- Shows wizard instead of simple empty state
- Tracks completion in localStorage per project
- Seamless transition to Kanban board after completion

## Key Features

### User Experience
- **Progressive disclosure**: One step at a time, not overwhelming
- **Flexible**: All fields optional, can skip entirely
- **Visual progress**: Step indicator shows 1/3, 2/3, 3/3
- **Keyboard shortcut education**: Prominently displays "C" shortcut
- **Smart defaults**: Uses existing script placeholders from system config

### Technical Implementation
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly layout
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation, clear focus states
- **Performant**: Loads templates only when needed
- **Persistent**: Remembers setup completion per project
- **Error handling**: Graceful error states throughout

## Design Consistency
- Uses shadcn/ui Card, Button, Alert components
- Matches existing color scheme and spacing
- Follows same patterns as project-form-fields
- Consistent with ProjectFormDialog structure

## Files Changed

### New Files
1. `frontend/src/components/projects/ProjectSetupWizard.tsx` (407 lines)
2. `tasks/new-project-setup/research.md`
3. `tasks/new-project-setup/plan.md`
4. `tasks/new-project-setup/summary.md`

### Modified Files
1. `frontend/src/pages/project-tasks.tsx`
   - Added ProjectSetupWizard import
   - Added setup completion state tracking
   - Added wizard display logic
   - Added complete/skip handlers

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User creates new project or opens project with no tasks
2. System checks: `tasks.length === 0 && !setupComplete && !isLoading && !!project`
3. If true, shows wizard instead of empty state
4. User configures scripts (or leaves blank)
5. User selects task templates (or skips)
6. User completes setup, tasks are created
7. localStorage stores completion flag
8. Kanban board shows with newly created tasks (or empty)

### Skip Flow
- User can skip at any step
- Clicking "Skip Setup" marks setup as complete
- Never shows wizard again for that project
- User can still configure scripts later via project settings

### Data Persistence
- Script configurations saved via updateProject mutation
- Tasks created via tasksApi.create()
- Setup completion stored in localStorage: `project-setup-complete-${projectId}`

## Testing Checklist

✅ Type checking passes (`npm run check`)
✅ Rust compilation passes (`cargo check`)
✅ Component structure follows existing patterns
✅ Integrates with existing project context
✅ Uses existing API endpoints
✅ Error handling implemented
✅ Loading states implemented
✅ Skip functionality implemented
✅ Template selection works with empty state
✅ Keyboard shortcut reminder displayed

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add animations between steps
2. Save in-progress wizard state (allow resuming)
3. Add "tour" mode to highlight wizard features
4. Analytics to track which templates are most popular
5. Allow editing setup without clearing tasks
6. Add more default templates
7. Import templates from other projects

## Usage Example

```typescript
// When a new project with no tasks is opened:
// 1. ProjectTasks page detects empty state
// 2. Shows ProjectSetupWizard component
// 3. User configures scripts and selects templates
// 4. Tasks created, wizard hidden
// 5. Normal Kanban board displayed
```

## API Dependencies

- `templatesApi.listGlobal()` - Fetch global templates
- `templatesApi.listByProject(projectId)` - Fetch project templates
- `updateProject.mutate()` - Save script configurations
- `tasksApi.create(taskData)` - Create tasks from templates

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers (same as rest of application)
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+

## Conclusion

The new project setup flow significantly improves the first-run experience by:
1. Guiding users through essential project configuration
2. Helping them create their first tasks from templates
3. Educating them about keyboard shortcuts
4. Making the empty board state productive rather than intimidating

The implementation follows all codebase conventions, passes type checking, and integrates seamlessly with existing features.
